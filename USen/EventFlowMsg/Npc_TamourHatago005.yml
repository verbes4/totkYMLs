  around here? Monsters are everywhere!
  
  So I came up with this idea... I'll hang up
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of Octorok Lake <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>when it looks
  like a monster, and that'll scare them off.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>The lake is south of here, and it looks like
  any ol' lake until the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>water rises<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Then it
  takes the<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> shape of an Octorok monster<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>The thing is,<5 Type='0'/> it's not a good idea to leave
  the stable unattended just to go paint a
  picture.<5 Type='0'/> You know?

  off any monsters that threaten the stable.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>Please leave our flower garland alone.
  If you really want one...
  
  try picking one up at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  in the mountain range to the southwest
  of here.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>You like that, do you? It's nice, isn't it?
  I hear they're all the rage right now.
  
  I guess those things got their start in
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. I've been told a little
  girl makes them all on her own!
  The village is southwest of here in
  Necluda, so if you ever pass through,
  you should see if you can find one.

  Goodbye.

  monster <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>when the water rises...a rainy
  day could be a good time to check it out.
DoNotWakka_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Look, I can see you've taken a liking
  to it, but that belongs to the stable, so
  it's not yours to have.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>If you want one of your own, just visit
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's southwest of here!

  I'm not showing you.
Com_Photo_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>If you happen to have a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of
  Octorok Lake in the shape of an Octorok<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  I sure hope you'll show it to me.
Com_Photo_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Aha! This is just right! Now we'll have a
  monster of our own to protect us.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>I tell you, I could paint pictures of
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Octorok Lake looking like a monster<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  all day.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>So, if you have an image of the lake that
  you like better, bring it by and I'll use it
  as inspiration for a new painting!
WakkaCharm: |
  We have one here too.
Com_Photo_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>I have to say, the lake really does look
  like a big monster.
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003000'/>The best way to fight monsters is with
  your own monsters, right?<5 Type='0'/> Yeah, I just
  know this painting is going to protect us!

  at Bloodleaf Lake to the north?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I hear that if he takes a liking to you, he
  can boost your horse's abilities or even
  bring your equine friend back to life!
  It sounds far-fetched, but it'd be fantastic
  if it's true.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>How lucky would our stable be if a horse

  I can only imagine!

  when it's in the shape of an Octorok<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  I just know it'd help keep monsters away.
  Ah, but I don't have time to go all the way
  there and paint it. So who knows how
  this'll ever get done.
9006: |
  I'd like to change it.
9007: |
  It's fine the way it is.

  What a perfect way to ward off monsters!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>I see it's your first time with us here at

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>It's both your first time at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>East Akkala

  so here...
Com_Photo_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>So<5 Type='0'/> I did some thinking about what kind of
  picture I'd like to hang up.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>There's this big lake right to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>south<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of
  here called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Octorok Lake<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  It looks like any other lake at first glance,
  but when the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>water level rises<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...it takes
  the shape of a monster called an Octorok!
  That's how it got its name, I suppose.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Anyway, I'd like to paint a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of
  Octorok Lake when it looks like an
  Octorok <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and hang it on the wall.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>And who knows, with all the monsters
  showing up lately, maybe it'll help keep
  them away.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>The thing is,<5 Type='0'/> I can't exactly leave the
  stable unattended just to go paint
  a picture.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But if I had a picture of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Octorok Lake in
  its Octorok shape<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> right in front of me,<5 Type='0'/>
  well, <5 Type='0'/>I'm sure I could paint it.
