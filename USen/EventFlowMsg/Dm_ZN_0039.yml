  Then...what exactly are you suggesting we do with
  the sword?
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_d: |
  That act is forbidden for a very good reason! It would
  mean throwing yourself awaâ€”
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_e: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_013_bb: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_014_c: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_007_c: |
  I can think of one way...
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_023_ac: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_017_c: |
  I...
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_002_c: |
  Even someone like him has vulnerabilities.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_016_ab: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_020_c: |
  Very well, then. As a Zonai, I bear my share of blame
  for these events...
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_022_ab: |
  For the swordsman Link, I will do everything I can.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_c: |
  Over time, the Master Sword is able to absorb sacred
  power. It can heal itself and even grow stronger!
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_022_ac: |
  Even if my body should perish, I will still be with
  you in spirit.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_d: |
  Curious... If we were able to empower it in that way,
  it could be the key to defeating the Demon King.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_015_c: |
  You...won't be able to change back.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_e: |
  But...it could take centuries for that sword to grow
  strong enough. The power the Demon King wields...
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_008_c: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_000_c: |
  You're saying that sword traveled through time
  the same way you did?
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_005_f: |
  I do not see how this can be done. It would be
  impossible for you to provide it with sacred power
  for so long.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_010_c: |
  You mean...
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_018_d: |
  I want to restore the Master Sword and deliver it
  to Link!
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_020_ac: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_003_c: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_013_c: |
  Oh, Mineru!
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_021_c: |
  So I too will devote myself to this goal...and to this
  hero of yours.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_024_b: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_aab: |
  Yes. I can do it. I have to.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_016_c: |
  The moment I had the sword, I knew what to do.
  I knew this was why I came to this era.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_001_c: |
  Yes. But more importantly, in my original time...
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_019_abb: |
  
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_019_ac: |
  I understand.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_019_c: |
  You really...have made up your mind?
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_001_d: |
  the Demon King was vulnerable to even the
  smallest piece of this sword.
Dm_ZN_0039_Text_011_c: |
  I've told you!
