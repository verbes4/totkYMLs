  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Endura carrots are harder to find than
  you'd think!
  
  But that's OK. I get sick easily, and the
  fresh air is probably good for me.
  
  Anyway, if my wife and I don't find some
  soon, we'll move our search higher up
  the mountain.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm starting to think there aren't any
  endura carrots around here.
  
  Maybe it's time to check higher up
  the mountain. After all, now I'm well
  enough to actually climb it.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's starting to rain! Let's head over there.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We're going to wait to search for endura
  carrots until after the rain has passed.
  
  I don't want to catch a cold and worry
  my wife.

  Like talking with my wife about what we're
  going to do tomorrow.
  When I was sick, I could barely speak,
  let alone think about making plans.
  
  Thank goodness you came along with
  those Gleeok guts.

  so kind to us back in Gerudo Canyon!
  Fancy running into you here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I take it you're looking for endura carrots?
  
  
  My wife and I too. She's hoping they'll
  beef up my constitution a bit.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>We haven't found any, but between you
  and me? I don't mind. I'm happy just
  spending time with her like this.

  The stars, the cool air... Glad I'm healthy
  enough to enjoy it all.
