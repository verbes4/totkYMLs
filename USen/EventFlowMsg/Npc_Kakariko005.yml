  No, that's not right...<5 Type='1'/> You're the only one for me,
  my love. I was an idiot, like always... <5 Type='1'/>Ooo,
  I think she'll like that better.
  *sigh* I had no idea it would be this hard to
  face her...<FontSize Value='100'/>

Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>This is my home. Or rather...it used to be.
  
  
  It was partially destroyed by the falling
  ruins. I said I didn't care what they did
  with it after that and set off on a journey.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Big mistake. I thought they would just
  remove the rubble. I didn't think they'd
  go and build a research facility here...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Sorry you had to see me like that.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I was just a little shocked to see my
  home...er, transformed like that.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But if my home is useful as a place of
  research for my village, I'm thrilled!
  I, Cado, am happy to donate my house!

Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, it's just that my house was turned
  into a research facility while I was away
  on my journey.
  But if my home is useful to the village like
  this, I'm thrilled! I welcome the change!
  I, Cado, am happy to donate my house!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Ah, if it isn't Sir Link! What's on
  your mind?
  
  As for me, I just came by to check on my
  precious Cuccos!
  
  I never imagined that my house would be
  turned into a research facility while I was
  traveling. Life is full of surprises!
  It's a tough reality to accept... <5 Type='1'/>Luckily,
  I've managed to accept it easily, so don't
  you worry about Cado!
Talk_26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I trained my precious Cuccos to protect
  the village from the Yiga Clan while I
  was away...
  But I fear I may have been too strict with
  their training.
  
  Ever since I've returned, none of them
  will come and see me...

  The Cuccos!
  
  I was just doing the rounds, making sure
  my precious Cuccos are doing well!
