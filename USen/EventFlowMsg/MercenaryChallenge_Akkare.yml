  If you're so inclined, Link, perhaps we can

  As leader of this squad, it pains me that
  I have to stay here and prepare a backup

  Link, if you could assist my squad, I'm
  certain it would raise their morale.

  When the sky turns crimson, the monsters

  We should all rest when we can so

  Link, if you were by our side, I'm sure
