  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Those legendary clothes are supposed
  to be in a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> somewhere along the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>coastline<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Problem is, there's a lot of coastline,
  and no way to narrow things down!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>I've heard that if you walk with your eyes
  up, you'll find it right away...
  
  But it's supposed to be in a cave, I think.
  Caves are usually close to the ground,
  right?<5 Type='0'/> Where is this treasure?!
GoRange_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I've tracked a piece of Misko's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>legendary

  the nearby Floria River!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Which would be great...<5 Type='0'/>if the river hadn't
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>flooded the cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and I weren't wearing
  designer clothes. What do I do now?
GoRange_02_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I got a hot tip that the treasure is hidden
  in a cave along the coastline.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Yep. Somewhere along this...very, very
  long coastline.<0 Type='4'/>I have heard it's easier to find the cave
  if you "walk with your eyes up."<0 Type='4'/>Though honestly, that doesn't make much

  Sounds like a pretty great tip, right? It is,
  until you remember how big the sea is...
  That's a lot of ground to cover.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Apparently the key to finding it is to
  "walk with your eyes up"...<5 Type='0'/>but it just
  feels weird to look up for a cave.
