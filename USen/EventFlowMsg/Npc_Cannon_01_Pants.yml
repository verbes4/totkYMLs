  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I got to a good stopping point with
  my work, so I plopped down here in
  the springs to restore myself.

  things about Goron Hot Springs, but
  there's no denying it's the best.
  My stiff, achy muscles are getting all
  loose and floppy thanks to the magic of
  these waters.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>If you can't tell, I just love this place.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hey, stop adding outside water!<0 Type='4'/>It's not the temperature that matters at
  a hot spring. It's the water quality!<0 Type='4'/>So please don't dilute it with...wherever
  that came from.

  springs around here in Eldin are
  piping hot.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Recently Death Mountain calmed down,
  so the waters have cooled to a
  temperature Hylians can enjoy.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Even with the waters being as perfect as
  they are, some folks have a rough time
  climbing up to Goron Hot Springs.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>So there's always the springs located
  in front of Bedrock Bistro. Those
  ones are relatively easier to get to.

  Hot Springs.

  up in the northwest are your best bet
  for something hot in someplace cold.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>There are three secret springs in the
  Hebra Mountains, but it's absolutely
  frigid there.
  You'd be risking your life if you
  tried going.

  to give up due to inclement weather.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>You know, I've also heard that on clear
  nights, there's an extremely rare aurora
  phenomenon that sets the sky alight.

  springs to choose from. Ultimately,
  it's a cost-benefit analysis.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>How quickly and easily can you achieve
  contentment? <5 Type='0'/>That's what you've got to

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>By that measure, the Meda Mountain
  secret springs would be my top
  recommendation.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>There's a place called Hateno Village to
  the south. Meda Mountain is on the road
  leading there.
  Nothing more than a little detour to find
  it. The scenery's a beaut, and the springs
  themselves? Perfection.
