Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Do you think you could go into the sky if
  you had lots of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>big balloons<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> like the one
  on the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>other side of the pond<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>There aren't many clouds right now, so
  you can get a really good look at the
  land in the sky!
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>It's all dark and dreary now, so you can
  barely see the land in the sky.
Talk_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's really easy to slip in the rain, and
  lightning can be dangerous...
  
  That's why my grandpa told me good kids
  take shelter when it rains!
  
  Come on, mister, let's go find a tree to
  hide under!
