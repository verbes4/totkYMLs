  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you!
Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I see...<5 Type='0'/>Please show me a picture some
  other time, then.
Talk_16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I see...<5 Type='0'/> Well, if you change your mind,
  please come talk to me.
Talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh yes, and please take this too!<5 Type='0'/>
  This dish is a stable specialty.
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>What a superb picture!<5 Type='0'/> It's exactly what
  I was hoping for!
Talk_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I have to tell you, <5 Type='0'/>this is the last of the
  paintings to go up. With this bit of art,
  all the stables have been decorated!
  And from what I hear,<5 Type='0'/> it was you who
  helped get pictures put on the walls of
  the other stables, too, Link.
  As a way of saying thanks for all your
  help, I'd like to give you a gift from the
  Stable Association. Please, take it.

Talk_22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This is a nice picture, yes,<5 Type='0'/> but what I'd
  like to hang on the wall is...different.
Talk_23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Appreciate the thought, but...<5 Type='0'/>it's not quite
  the imagery I'm going for.
Talk_24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Ah, hold on,<5 Type='0'/> it doesn't seem like you have
  room in your pouch.
Talk_100: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I understand.<5 Type='0'/> The painting really is
  wonderful. I'm happy to leave it as is.
Talk_25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I was thinking of sending five servings
  of our stable's own <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>specialty dish<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> with
  you, but...
Talk_26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>This would really liven up the look around
  here. <5 Type='0'/>Is it OK if I paint a copy?
Talk_27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I was thinking of giving you a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>diamond<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  from the Stable Association, but...

  the stable the moment it was hung on
  the wall.
Talk_28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Now, just give me a moment to whip up a
  reproduction. <5 Type='0'/>Haha, don't worry! I'm quite
  good at this, I promise.
Talk_29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Wonderful. Give me a moment to make
  a copy.<5 Type='0'/> Don't worry, I'm quick with
  the paintbrush!
Talk_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link,<5 Type='0'/> has that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>empty frame <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>caught
  your eye?
0001: |
  Let me pick another.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Phew...finished!<5 Type='0'/> These pictures of yours
  really are extraordinary, Link.
  
  If you capture another one you like,
  please don't hesitate to show it to me.
Talk_02: |
  Work in progress. Do not touch.

  Never mind.
Talk_31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I hate not being able to thank you
  properly after you've done so much
  for us.
  I'll give you your gift once you've made
  room to carry it. Just come see me when
  you're ready.
Talk_107: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Ah, I know how you feel.<5 Type='0'/> That picture,
  it's really something... It just stops you
  in your tracks, doesn't it?
Talk_32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ah, Link.<5 Type='0'/> Are you here to pick up your
  reward for helping put pictures in the
  stable frames?
Talk_108: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>All right, then.<5 Type='0'/> Sorry for pestering you.
  Please enjoy your time at the stable.
Talk_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I knew it! It's perfect for this stable!<5 Type='0'/>
  And it's all thanks to you, Link.
Talk_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Oh, but...<5 Type='0'/>it looks like your pouch is still
  filled to the brim.
0005: |
  Sure.
Talk_34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Yes, then here it is...a token to show
  our thanks.
Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, <5 Type='1'/>Link! It looks like you've saved up
  some Pony Points!
  
  If you'd like to trade them in<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> for a reward<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  please <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>head to the counter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link,<5 Type='0'/> do you still have your eye on
  that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>empty frame<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Talk_35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I was thinking I'd give you a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>special dish<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  from our stable, but...
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Can I see it?
Talk_36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Thank you for a truly splendid picture.<5 Type='0'/>
  Please, feel free to use the stable
  whenever you want.
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Aha!<5 Type='0'/> This is exactly the picture
  I asked for!
Talk_37: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm happy to swap the painting in the
  frame for a different one. If you have an
  image you like, please just let me know!
Talk_95: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1c005100750065007300740069006f006e004e006f0072006d0061006c00'/>Oh, you don't want to change it, then?
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The Stable Association has decided we
  stable owners should display pictures on
  our walls for the enjoyment of our guests.
  They've advised us to start by hanging
  up frames.
  
  Yep, you'll find frames like this one here
  on stable walls all across the land!
Talk_38: |
  To show my appreciation, I'm giving you
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>one <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>Pony Point.
Talk_96: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You want to switch out the picture,
  do you? Can I see the new one first?
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I'm sorry, Link.<5 Type='0'/> That's not quite what I
  was looking for.
Talk_39: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>I wanted to give you our stable's most
  recommended <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>elixir<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's especially useful
  for travelers...but, well...
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Oh no,<5 Type='0'/> that's too bad...
Talk_40: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yes, and take this too! It's something a
  traveler like you will find handy when
  faced with harsh terrain and weather.
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Oh, well, that's a shame.<5 Type='0'/> Without some
  kind of picture for reference, there's no
  way I can paint the scene I had in mind.
Talk_41: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Speaking of pictures, there's this
  researcher at Lookout Landing
  named <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Robbie<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  He was saying he has this thing called a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You can point it at scenery and
  it makes a picture out of it.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Some folks come up with some pretty
  incredible inventions, don't they?
Talk_99: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you.<5 Type='0'/> So I'll replace that picture
  with this one, then?
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We stable owners are going to be
  putting paintings on display for
  everyone to enjoy.
  The Stable Association figured it'd be a
  good idea for us to hang the frames first
  to get ready.
Talk_42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Link, have you ever heard the word
  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>" before?
  
  I hear it's some gadget that can make a
  picture out of whatever you point it at.
  And it does it lightning fast too! 
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>This researcher at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lookout Landing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  knows all about it. Honestly though,
  I'm not sure I believe it exists.
