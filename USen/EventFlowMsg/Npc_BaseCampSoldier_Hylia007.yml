  Things feel different...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Well, it's a big relief having you back.<0 Type='4'/>I'm sure you've been through a lot,
  returning to us. So, just know that
  Lookout Landing is here for you.
  Be sure to get some rest, Link.

  from our <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> here!
  
  I helped construct the tower, since we're
  short on workers.
  
  Ever since it was finished, we all
  wondered who'd be brave enough
  to launch for the first time.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>Of course it was you, Link!

  and talk to me.
  
  To be honest, I saw you from the top of
  the wall as soon as you got back.
  
  You looked a little preoccupied, so I
  decided not to say anything.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>Anyway, you looked brilliant soaring

  It's not safe being that high up!
