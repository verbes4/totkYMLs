  across the Tabantha Great Bridge
  out front.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>And I imagine a painting of those columns
  basking in a majestic <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> would
  make our customers very happy.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003100'/>But I've given up on painting it myself now
  that I've seen how terrifying the monsters
  on that mountain can be.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>They come straight from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  in Necluda, east of Central Hyrule.
  They're a local specialty, or so I'm told.

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  The village is in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Necluda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, far southeast of
  us.<5 Type='0'/> Given your clear enthusiasm, though,
  it might be worth the trip.
