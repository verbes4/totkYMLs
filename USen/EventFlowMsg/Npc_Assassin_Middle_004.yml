  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>As a blademaster, you are allowed entry
  to the inner sanctum.<0 Type='4'/>Feel free to take your time in there. I will
  be here waiting for another blademaster
  candidate to arrive.
  I only hope whoever's next can live up
  to your outstanding example.<5 Type='1'/>

  Can't believe it's his now...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You are now officially a blademaster.<0 Type='4'/>Why not go visit the hideout to spread
  the good news?<0 Type='4'/>Remember, it's in Karusa Valley, north of
  Gerudo Town.<0 Type='4'/>For anyone else, I'd say that's quite a
  journey, but given what you're capable
  of, you'll be fine.
  Besides, it's important that the Yiga Clan
  knows we have a new blademaster to
  look up to!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hi there! It's been a while. How are you
  enjoying being a blademaster?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>It's rare that the Yiga sees a new member
  worthy of the title. I expect you to wear it
  well and do Master Kohga proud!

  The Lightning Helm!
