Talk_1120: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Look, it takes sleep to burn so bright, so

Talk_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Also, if you thought cliffs being <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>harder to

  you've clearly never been zapped.

  non-stop, red-hot lava.
  But now the lava's all cooled down and
  hardened into a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new road <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>that's super
  easily walkable.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>And there's nothing red hot about
  "easily walkable"!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Now on the other hand, the route
  going up to Death Mountain from
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Foothill Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  That's an old, dangerous road absolutely
  crawling with monsters. If you're looking
  for "red hot," that's where to find it.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Thing is...<5 Type='0'/>my muscles aren't exactly ready

  If I had a balloon like the one on the other
