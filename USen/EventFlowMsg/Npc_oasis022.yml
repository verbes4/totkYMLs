  It looks like the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>vai from out of town <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>have
  adjusted to life here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Knowing that, it makes all the hard work

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I suppose I can tell you. After all, your
  situation is unique.
  
  As it happens, young Gerudo aren't
  traditionally allowed to interact with voe.
  
  And for vai born outside town, when they
  reach a certain age, they're summoned
  back to Gerudo Town.

  and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Mattison<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  You can easily tell which two they are—
  they're very small!
  
  Aaqlet's mother, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Perda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, is working at
  a...<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>frustrating shop<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so she's rarely seen

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>I can tell Aaqlet misses her though.
  She keeps going down into the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shelter <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to

  She recently arrived here along with her

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But Perda started working at one of the

  So she is rarely in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shelter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> anymore.
  
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='1000540069007200650064005f0030003100'/>That must be why Aaqlet spends so much

  It was like the sun itself was coming to

  She's always smiling, even though I'm
