  Make an offering...
  
  
  Offer <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to me...spirits that ought to
  return to the afterlife.
  
  They are pitiful beings who have lost
  their way home and wander this land.
  
  I am one who returns all Poes to the
  afterlife without prejudice...
  
  Good... Evil... That's the futile perspective
  of narrow-minded beings... There is no
  such distinction in wandering spirits...
