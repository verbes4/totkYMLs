  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're looking into the unusual
  phenomena, yeah?
  
  I've also been receiving <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>information<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> from
  my allies I sent to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  We're all doing our part.
talk_1_42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey! This area is off-limits while we
  conduct our search for Princess Zelda
  and Link.
  You can't just come wandering in here
  like that.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Link? It's you?!
  
  
  I'm sorry! I had no idea that you
  had returned!
  
  Wait, if you're back, then does that mean
  we don't need the search party anymore?<5 Type='1'/>
  
  Huh...<5 Type='1'/> You should go talk to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Captain
  Hoz<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—he's leading search efforts here
  from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>first gatehouse <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>up ahead.
  You'll find it at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>very end of this road<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk_HighMountain009_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The return of the Demon King is troubling.
  But I've gathered <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>information<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> from allies I
  sent to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky island<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Even Tulin, who's still so young, is doing
  remarkable work. We all have to do what
  we can.
talk_1_43: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Just like I thought, the weapons here have
  all decayed too.
  
  I wonder if there are any intact weapons
  left anywhere in the world...
talk_HighMountain009_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>According to my allies, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  are often located above large ruins and
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai ruins <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>found on the surface.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Maybe there's some kind of causal
  relationship.

talk_HighMountain009_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, is Penn all right? You were
  investigating the rumor about Princess
  Zelda together, weren't you?
  He's such an honest guy and doesn't
  care much for falsehoods. Look out for
  him, will you?
talk_1_45: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I finished up the search around here, and
  I'm ready for my next instructions.
  
  But <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Captain Hoz <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is, uh...<5 Type='0'/>kind of on edge.
  I don't want to bother him.
talk_HighMountain009_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>According to our allies, it seems
  there are often sky islands above
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Towers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I heard that such towers were constructed
  by Purah to survey the land.
  
  I wonder if it's a coincidence or rather
  some sort of cause and effect.
talk_1_46: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Wait...<5 Type='1'/> What...<5 Type='1'/>
talk_HighMountain009_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Our allies told us that there are some
  pretty <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>big sky islands <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>as compared
  to others.
  In those ones, there are ring-shaped
  statues with floating <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>green handprints<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  We don't know what purpose they
  serve though.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I wonder what they could be for...
talk_1_47: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This area is restricted only to those
  involved in the search for Princess Zelda.
  
  This is by direct order of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Captain Hoz<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  If you insist on passing, you'll need
  permission from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>captain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  He should be in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>first gatehouse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, up at

talk_3_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh, what're you doing up here?
  
  
  This is the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>switch. It's for

  I can't say I'm surprised. You've got
  such spirit!
talk_ZoraFencer_32: |
  This place is so dry.
talk_1_48: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Sounds like we need to change
  our approach.
  
  Since the princess flew off, maybe we
  should redirect our efforts and dig into
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. <5 Type='0'/>For now, at least.
  I've already got a few regions in mind to
  start exploring.
  
  I bet we'll pick up clues about where she
  flew off to as we look around.
talk_3_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But Skyview Towers are about more than
  just traveling quickly.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>I hear that the Princess Zelda who
  appeared at the castle was naught but a
  copy under the Demon King's command.
  There is no doubt that this impostor is
  the same wretch who loosed the sludge
  monster upon King Dorephan.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Link.<5 Type='1'/> I know it is far too little too late,
  and I dearly wish I had voiced this sooner,
  but... I am so sorry for doubting you.
  If we end up battling the Demon King,<5 Type='0'/>
  the ravages of war will be inescapable
  yet again.
  I fear that many burdens will rain upon
  the crown of King Sidon, as much as I
  wish I could shield him from it.

  It's his favorite place, after all. It's out on
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule Ridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the west of here.
  
  The wind feels especially pleasant there.
  If you find yourself in the area, you should

talk_ZoraFencer_38: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>These geoglyphs are large designs drawn

  It seems that the revered elder of the

  I have lived a very long time and have

  The greater the battle, the greater the
  sorrow that is left in its wake.
  
  I dearly wish that our King Sidon will not
  have to experience any such sorrow.
