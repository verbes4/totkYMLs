  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004300680061007400'/>The carvings of all those heroes—they're
  really something. Such craftsmanship.
  
  They were carved right into the mountain
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>northwest <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of here to protect <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  What I'd like to do is hang up a painting
  of the Champion <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Daruk<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. His carving is up
  there at the highest point.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Hmm, but I'll need to go get a look at it
  if I'm going to paint it. I just don't have
  time for that.

  feel has changed completely.
  
  May Daruk's divine strength protect
  everyone who visits this stable.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Well, the mountain path that leads to
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>northwest <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>from here connects with
  Goron City.
  But the road's been busted up since
  the Upheaval and isn't used much.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>These days, it's mostly just a den for
  monsters—and a dangerous one at that.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You may want to take a safer route to
  Goron City.
  
  If so, I recommend you head south along
  the road, turn to the west, and then take
  the mountain path from Woodland Stable.

  isn't it?<5 Type='0'/> It's called a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring garland<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  They're sold in a place called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko

  bring good luck. You might say it's the
  inn's lucky charm.
BurnedWakka_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>You seem very focused on this garland.
  Perhaps you should just go buy one
  for yourself, hm?
  Head to the mountains south of here
  and you'll find them for sale in
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  that things in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zora's Domain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> aren't
  so good right now.
  Word is some goopy stuff called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sludge <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Zora's Domain is to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeast <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of here,

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Still, I can't help but worry this sludge will

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I have to say, I'm quite proud of how this
  turned out! *sigh* It was so much fun to
  paint again after all this time.
  In fact, I'm enjoying this so much that if
  you end up with a different <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of
  the Daruk sculpture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, please let me know.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I'll be sure to paint that one too and

  We have the same thing.

  I heard rumors that the horse god moved
  to<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> Akkala<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Talk is he can resurrect dead horses. Just
  the kinda thing you'd expect of a god.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I can't help but think things would've

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>Aw, don't listen to me. I should stop

  Back to work, back to work!
Com_Photo_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>It captures the essence of the renowned
  Champion, don't you think? You can really
  sense Daruk's strength, even here.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004300680061007400'/>We get a lot of customers stopping by this
  stable on their way to visit Goron City.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>So I've been thinking it might be nice
  for them if I hung up a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of the
  Daruk sculpture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> overlooking the city.

  I want to change it.

  It's almost as if the Champion Daruk is
  watching over us.
Com_Photo_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Anyway,<5 Type='0'/> is there something you'd like to

  So, I was thinking, maybe I'll hang a
  painting of the sculpture of the Goron
  Champion, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Daruk<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  You know...<5 Type='0'/>the big statue that's sculpted

  If I had some kind of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>image<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to use as
