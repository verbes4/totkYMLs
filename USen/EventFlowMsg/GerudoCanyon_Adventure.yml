  with its cold and heat. Your travels may
  prove your end. But if you succeed...
  I will name you a blademaster.
  
  
  Furthermore, I will personally give you

  It is where Yiga blademasters are made

  As someone who knows it inside and out,
  I have one piece of advice.
  If you cannot find a frog statue,
  challenge yourself...to think things
  through from a different angle.
  A blademaster must be able to take a
  broad view of a problem.

  respect that.
  However...if you want to make a more

  Stay calm. Make haste.
