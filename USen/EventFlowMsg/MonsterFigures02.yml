  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Kilton...would it be all right if I made more
  sculptures? For you, I mean.
  
  Been a while since I've been this excited
  about making stuff.

  Why, if those aren't the exact words
  I wanted to fall into my ears!
  
  Yes, thank you! Thank you, yes!
Talk16: |
  <FontSize Value='125'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ha-hiyeeee!<FontSize Value='100'/>
  
  
  Why, this monster sculpture... It's more
  impressive than I dreamed possible!
Talk45: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Though it would help if you got better
  at, you know...describing monsters.
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It was nothing.

  another picture of a monster.
Talk47: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yep, it would be a big help if somebody
  brought us a picture.
Talk19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Now, would you find the most-perfect
  spot for this sculpture on the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stage<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  over there? Please?
Talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Afraid I can't do that.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>Bwaaa?
Talk22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Pretty sure I said I can't be responsible
  for that sort of thing. Too big a decision.
  Too much responsibility. Hard pass.
Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Awww... If only someone would <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>move it to
  the stage<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and place it in a pleasing spot.
Talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>We went to so much trouble to get this
  sculpture sculpted.
  
  I want nothing more than to give it the
  many looking eyeballs it deserves.
Talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>Hwaaah?! What did you say?
Talk26: |
  <FontSize Value='125'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ooh! OOOOOOH!<FontSize Value='100'/>
  
  
  It looks so natural here and so realistic
  too! It's as if we've stumbled on a
  monster's lair.
  Yes, it's exactly what I was hoping for!
Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Even I could swear I see the wind ruffling
  its coat.
Talk28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>A magnificent picture-painting indeed.
  And yes, that is very truly a monster!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Just...one teensy problem. It isn't a
  Horriblin.
  
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Horriblin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has an astonishing patch of
  fur on its back like OOOHWOW, while its
  adorable hands are big like VWOOSH!
Talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Everyone in the village seemed to like it,
  so I could probably make more.
0001: |
  How about this picture?
Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Yes! Now we must put it in front of every
  face in the village.
Talk02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Haarooo! Really?!
  
  
  In that case, I implore you to make a
  Horriblin next.
  
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Horriblins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> have big hands like VWOOSH
  and a coat that's quite OOHWOW! They
  also enjoy swinging from the ceiling.
0002: |
  I'll leave you to it.
Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!
  
  
  I present to you a new species of monster
  called the Horriblin.
  
  Do not fear, draw near! This is the
  only place you can safely admire such
  a creature up close. The only place!
Talk03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmm. Your description...<5 Type='0'/>no...<5 Type='0'/>I still don't
  know what it looks like.
0003: |
  Of course!
Talk32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oooh, a new species?
Talk04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Sorry. So sorry! I am an awful describer
  of things.
  
  I would draw you a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>detailed picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of a
  Horriblin if I could. But there is no art to
  be found in the bones of my body.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But fret not! I, Kilton, will describe the
  monster to you with much fervor and
  many times over. Surely that will help!
0004: |
  I'll pick a different one.
Talk33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ahem. This sight has stolen your eyes.
  Now, give me your ears! All of them!
  
  Once again, this monster is the lovable
  Horriblin.
  
  This new monster was discovered
  in caves created by the Upheaval.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>And what a stylish monster it is!
  See how its colorful hair sprouts from
  its tough skin!
  You feel the urge to reach out and ruffle
  its locks, don't you? Yes! I feel that very
  same feeling so very much!
  And yet, it might be best to keep your
  hands to yourself...if you want to keep
  your hands at all, that is.
Talk05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Eh, well, <5 Type='0'/>it would be better if I had
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>detailed picture <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to look at.<5 Type='1'/>
0005: |
  Sorry, but no.
Talk34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It is rather stylish.
Talk06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What I'm saying is...
  
  
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Horriblin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has a colorful coat like
  OOOH WOW and a charming,
  droopy snout.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Its hands are big like VWOOSH! Yes,
  and it dangles from the ceiling too.
0006: |
  I found a nice spot for it.
Talk35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
  Understand what you fear and you'll
  feel great!
  For those with an open mind, wonders
  always await!
Talk07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmm. I'm trying, but I can't picture what
  it's supposed to look like.
  
  Without a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>detailed picture <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of that
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Horriblin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> thing, I'm not sure what
  I can do.
Talk36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you! Thank you!
  
  
  Again I find myself in your debt.
  
  
  Please, allow me to give you a gift to
  show my gratitude.

  the tip of the top!
  
  I've got a dish and some monster extract
  to give you, but first you'll have to make
  room to carry it.

  your mouth enjoys it!
  
  The homemade seasoning I gave you last
  time gives it its secret flavor. Since you're
  here, I'll give you another bottle!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>Hooyagee?! <5 Type='0'/>I was going to give you a

  Make some room in there and I'll give
  you the dish and monster extract I have
  waiting for you.

  have for such a thing,<5 Type='1'/> but I promise
  it's quite handy.
  For so long I've dreamed of collecting
  these sculptures and showing the world
  how wonderful monsters truly are.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>And now that dream is coming true...
  all because of you! Thank you!
  Thank you many times again!
Talk39: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Ahh...<5 Type='1'/> If only I had a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>detailed picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  of a Horriblin...
Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ah, now this is a good picture! Let me
  use it for reference, and I can make the
  sculpture, no problem.
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>M-may we borrow it?

  <FontSize Value='125'/><3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hoofaa! Awww!<FontSize Value='100'/>
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If I had that picture, the sculpture would
  be son and done. But...I can't force you.
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>All right, just leave it to me. I'll have it
  made, son and done!
