  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>"A dealer in life and power, touched by
  the wrath of the Goddess, fallen to ruin."
  
  So the horned statue must be the entity
  who deals in life and power...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004300680061007400'/>Which would make the dais the place
  where it was enshrined, back when
  it was still a god.
  As there is the Goddess of light, then it
  follows that she would have an opposite—
  the horned god.
  Like light and dark, one cannot exist
  without the other—their power manifests
  through the other's existence.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That's what I think, anyway. And that's
  all I've got for you. I'm going back to
  work now.
