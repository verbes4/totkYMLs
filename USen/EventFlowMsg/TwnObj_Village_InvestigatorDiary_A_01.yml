  We of the Zonai Survey Team were
  founded and tasked by Princess Zelda to
  study ruins and ancient documents.
  Through the lens of archaeological
  understanding, it is her hope that we will
  uncover the deep history of Hyrule.
  Due to the Upheaval, many ruins from
  the Zonai civilization came crashing down
  from the sky.
  We have known very little of the Zonai,
  but we may now have evidence that their
  culture once flourished in the sky above.
  Our chief executive is Tauro, the first
  individual in the world to find a clue to
  deciphering Zonai scripts.
  Our current surveys are wholly focused on
  learning more about the Zonai civilization.
  
  Research results are shared out to
  specialists at the base in Kakariko Village.

  The mysterious ruins that appeared due
  to the Upheaval—with strange, dome-like
  protrusions—we're calling "shrines."
  They are believed to be from the Zonai
  civilization, but exact details regarding
  these shrines are unknown.
  When observing shrines as well as fallen
