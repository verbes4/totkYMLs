  Work on the school has been moving
  along smoothly, but a major problem
  recently reared its head.<0 Type='4'/>We don't have enough teachers. Symin
  is interviewing people, but he hasn't
  found a good fit yet.<0 Type='4'/>I'd like to hire someone intelligent,
  educated, and capable of earning the
  children's trust.<0 Type='4'/>Nurturing our children is an extension of
  our duty to this land. We shape our future
  by the way we shape their path.<0 Type='4'/>I hope to see sterling members of our
  community come to this village and take
  up that mantle as their teacher.

  After the Calamity, I asked myself how to
  rebuild, and set out across Hyrule in
  search of an answer.<0 Type='4'/>I saw collapsed buildings, lost cities...
  The damage was far worse than I had
  imagined.<0 Type='4'/>But as I watched the people and heard
  their stories, I was convinced all was
  not lost.<0 Type='4'/>The people's spirits were not broken.
  They and their strong wills are Hyrule's
  greatest treasure.<0 Type='4'/>They are the ones who will rebuild, and
  my contribution to their efforts will be to
  protect them while they do so.

  As part of Hyrule's reconstruction, we've
  built a school in Hateno Village.<0 Type='4'/>It's the largest Hylian village, with its
  sprawling, bountiful land.<0 Type='4'/>There are so many children living here
  that it seemed the ideal place to found
  a school.<0 Type='4'/>I've recruited Symin from the research
  institute to teach there.<0 Type='4'/>He was Purah's assistant for years, which
  makes him well-equipped to deal with the
  needs of quirky children.<0 Type='4'/>I'll be overseeing the school for a while
  myself to keep an eye on the students.

  I commissioned Bolson, who taught his
  trade to Hudson of Hudson Construction,
  to construct the school for us.<0 Type='4'/>He seemed deeply moved by the request.
  This will be his final job in Hateno Village
  before he sets off on a journey.<0 Type='4'/><FontSize Value='80'/>I had him add a secret room to my houseâ€”one that
  won't appear on the plans. It's dim but humidity-
  and temperature-controlled, so it's very comfortable.<0 Type='4'/>It's proven very useful when I'm working alone and
  need to concentrate.<FontSize Value='100'/>
