  The sludge that was marring The Turning

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>I must report this to Lady Yona at once...
  Urp!<5 Type='1'/> Urgh...<5 Type='1'/> I would like to share this

  If only the waterfalls streaming out of the

  It is truly so necessary for it to be

  The treatment worked with such speed

  It is all thanks to Lady Yona's cure!
  
  
  All right! Oh, yeah! I will now get out

  You see, our brave Captain Bazz set out

  What's more, I am positively overflowing

  Captain Bazz set out for the Skyview

  That means we are short on Zora here.

  Us soldiers who remained behind must
