  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm going to keep practicing my singing in
  this well! The acoustics are really nice.
  
  Maybe I could live here? Then I'd never
  have to walk to practice my singing!
  
  Oh, but all these weapons are in the way.
  I don't need them, so take as many as
  you want!

  talking about?
  
  I wasn't singing anything remotely like
  that! I've never sung a song with
  those lyrics...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>♪Seek the storm, seek the storm...♪<5 Type='0'/>
  Is that maybe what you heard?
  
  Because that's what I was singing!

  What kind of nonsensical song is that?
  
  ♪Fear it not, you will stay warm.♪
  
  
  Those are the lyrics I was singing! And if
  you put it all together...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0201'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>It's a song about a cute little fox who is
  proud of their warm fur coat, and they
  chase storms since they don't get cold!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Anyway, I'm not trying to cause trouble
  or anything... <5 Type='1'/>But I don't think it's entirely
  my fault if people misheard things either.
  I just like how my voice sounds here.<5 Type='0'/>
  Prettier. More refined.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003000'/>Hmph. It sounded fine to me, but
  everyone else is hearing dire threats.
  
  "Leave the arms..." I guess that explains
  why weapons kept getting thrown in the
  well every morning.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm going to keep on practicing! It's the
  only way to keep getting better!
  
  Help yourself to these weapons—they just
  get in my way. <5 Type='1'/>Really, you're doing me a
  favor by taking them!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>They could be dangerous, so I collected
  them all over there.
  
  I've got no interest in them, so feel free
  to help yourself!
