Talk35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Look and learn! Then you won't hate!
  Understand what you fear and you'll
  feel great!
  For those with an open mind, wonders

Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Won't someone decorate the stage
  for me?
Talk36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you! Thank you!
  
  
  Hoohoohee, the stage has gotten so very
  busy. And it's all thanks to you!
  
  Please, take this gift as a sign of
  my gratitude.
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>M-may we borrow this picture?!
Talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>We went to so many troubles to get the
  sculpture made.
  
  All that's left is for it to be<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> placed upon
  the stage <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so all the eyeballs can see it.

  ago. I recommend using it on your
  favorite horse.
  Ah, and take this as well...
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If I had that picture, the sculpture would
  be son and done. But...I can't force you.

Talk38: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>For so long I've dreamed of collecting
  these sculptures and showing the world
  how wonderful monsters truly are.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>And now that dream is coming true...
  all because of you! Thank you!
  Thank you many times over!
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yep. Right. I'll get it built, son and done.

  See how it blends in there with the stage!
  Exactly the kind of clever camouflage
  you'd expect from a Battle Talus.
  Such artistry! It's exactly what I was
  hoping for.
0010: |
  Goodbye.
Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>There's no way anyone would know it's a
  monster at first glance.
Talk83: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Now, it would make a grin grow between
  my ears if you could select the perfect
  spot on the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stage<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for this sculpture.
Talk29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Used my imagination to fill in the blanks.
Talk16: |
  <FontSize Value='125'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ha-hiyaay!<FontSize Value='100'/>
  
  
  I-it's perfect! This monster sculpture
  doesn't have a single flaw!
Talk84: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sorry, I've got a rule against making
  that kind of decision. Too much
  responsibility. Not my thing.
Talk72: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If I had a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>detailed picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of a Battle
  Talus...or of some other monster...I could
  make a sculpture.
0013: |
  Got a monster in mind?
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Just like you asked.

  I've got monster extract to give you, but
  first you'll have to make room to carry it.
Talk73: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>If you have any <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster pictures<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on you,
  Hudson can use them to make more
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sculptures<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for me.<5 Type='1'/> So happy I will be!
0001: |
  How about this picture?
Talk86: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>Hooyagee?! <5 Type='0'/>I was going to give you
  a thank-you gifty, but that pouch of
  yours is full.
  Make some room in there and I'll give
  you the monster extract that's waiting
  for you.
Talk61: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>A grin is sure to grow between my ears if
  you have any <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster pictures <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>Hudson
  can use to make <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sculptures<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
0002: |
  Never mind.
0003: |
  Of course!
Talk76: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You see, a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Battle Talus<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is a monster, but
  it's ALSO a house. Or maybe it's a...fort?
  Hmmm, well...
  It's certainly a busybody in the truest
  sense! That is, it allows its friends to run
  about willy-nilly on its laaarge body.

  I'll pick a different one.

  I found a nice spot for it.

  In that case, a sculpture of a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Battle Talus<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  is what I desire more than anything.
Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Yes! Now let's put it before all the

Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!
  
  
  This is a Battle Talus...a creature sure to
  shock you when you first meet it.
  
  But do not fear. Draw near! This is the
  only place you can safely admire such
  a monster up close. The only place!
Talk32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Monster? It looks like a pile of rocks!
Near01: |
  If I had a monster picture...
Talk33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ahem. This sight has stolen your eyes.
  Now, give me your ears! All of them!
  
  Once again, this enchanting monster is a
  Battle Talus.
  
  With a body that looks made of rock, it
  doesn't mind that other monsters climb
  around it and build their nests upon it.
  It's a generous monster, you see, 
  both in the size of its body and the
  size of its heart!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Don't you wish you, too, could live on top
  of it? At the very least, I bet you wish
  you could give it a hug. I know I do!
  Sadly, they aren't known for enjoying
  such emotional outpourings...so it's
  best if you give them a wide berth.
