  Tell me about the bird.
Talk03_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah. <5 Type='1'/>Have you ever looked up at the
  peak of the spire here in Rito Village?
Talk03_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That bit jutting out sideways looks kind
  of like a bird's perch, right? <5 Type='0'/>We call it
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Vah Medoh's perch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Over there? No, I don't think that was it.

  Medoh's perch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, right?
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Hmmm. This is frustrating.
Talk06_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmm. <5 Type='0'/>Was there anything that stood out?
  Let me think...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmm. <5 Type='1'/>That cave...where was it again?<5 Type='1'/>
  Oh, hello.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>I saw one just the other day, in fact, while

Talk02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Yeah...there were mushrooms in it and
  a pond with fish. It would've been the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>It's weird for a bird to rest on a shadow,

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Part of my morning routine is to head up

  The resting white bird...

  There was a white bird?

  Any standout details?
