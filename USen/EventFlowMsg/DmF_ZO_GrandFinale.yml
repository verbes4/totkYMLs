  Please promise that you shall once again

  simply is not possible, is it?
  
  My ancestor lived in the distant past. It is
  difficult to imagine how the two could
  have crossed paths.
  There is little chance that Princess Zelda
  somehow ended up in ancient Hyrule.
GrandFinale_23: |
  We could not have achieved this without
  our dear King Sidon, our heroic Sir Link,
  and all of us who call the domain home.

  <4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003100'/>If by some strange occurrence that is so,
  that would mean she has journeyed to the
  bygone era of my ancient ancestor.
  Hm, and yet Father was attacked by
  Princess Zelda in the here and now...
  It does not add up.

GrandFinale_26: |
  I am so proud and so very grateful
  to count myself among the Zora of
  the domain.
GrandFinale_27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0600'/>However! That does not mean that all

  we need to know more!
GrandFinale_28: |
  So long as darkness lurks in the depths of
  Hyrule, this peace we have fought so hard
  for could vanish like a bubble on a needle.
GrandFinale_29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0601'/>We shall not allow that! It is now time for
  the Zora to help Link prevail! Everyone,
  I ask that you lend him your strength!

  in the domain and attacked Father...
  
  Could it be that the princess we saw in my
  ancestor's era and the one my father saw
  in this era are not one and the same?
GrandFinale_30: |
  Link. As I have just ascended the throne,
  I must offer my sincerest apologies for
  being unable to accompany you.

  painfully clear that we have no choice but
  to find the princess and ask her directly!
GrandFinale_31: |

  about our lost Princess Zelda.

  <4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003100'/>In stark contrast, the look-alike sighted in
  the present day is harming others and
  even attacked Father.
  As such, I can only believe that our
  princess is somehow in the bygone era
  of my ancient ancestor.
  However, if my hunch is correct, what is
  the true identity of the Princess Zelda
  who is running rampant in this era?
