  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This is the jail.
  
  
  Even though you have special permission
  to be in Gerudo Town, I still won't let you
  past this point.
  Really, the only way into jail is to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>break
  our rules<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Voe are normally not allowed inside our
  town—the one in jail broke that rule, so
  he's locked up.
  And, even though you have permission
  to be here, if you break the rules...
  
  you'll join him in jail.
