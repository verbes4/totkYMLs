  of mystery.
  
  The Zonai civilization comes up again and
  again in history books, but none really
  tells us much about who they were.

  When Hyrule itself was founded.

  under the castle... Hm...
  
  It's strong evidence that the books are
  correct—the Zonai and Hyrule shared
  some sort of history together.

  I'm sure they're Zonai in origin. I've seen
  designs like this in my studies.
  
  The Zonai are said to have lived long ago,
  in the time of earliest legend.
  
  They possessed godlike powers and had
  a prosperous civilization in the sky.

  Zonai, but none gives us the full picture.
  Much is still unknown about them.

  area come to be so forgotten? Why was
  our history left hidden here?
  Did the royal family in those ancient

  to remain secret and out of sight?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>When I was a child, I asked my father if

  No one in our family knew anything more
  than that.

  He said this warning had been passed

  They seem so different than us, and
  such large ears...
  How did the ruins from a civilization in the

  It looks like the path ahead goes even
  deeper. Let's continue, Link.

  Zonai civilization.
