  I'm from a little <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fishing village <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Are you interested in the lab?
  
  
  You're not going to find much of interest
  in the research documents there unless
  you're into that kind of thing.
  However, if you're interested in anything
  Zonai related, poke around some of the
  other researchers' tents.
  Some are knowledgeable about the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gloom<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. That might
