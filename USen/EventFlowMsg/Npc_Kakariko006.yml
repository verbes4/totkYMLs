  defense, right? And you can't use it to
  attack.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Or CAN you? You see, if you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>attach a

  and attack at the same time.
  Steen and I think it'd be worth trying

  that's more impressive in the end.
  So, attacking while defending—who knew
  that was possible. Yet it is, if you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>attach
  a weapon to your shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Steen and I are still working on this

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster horns <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rocks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Who'd have thought that two opinionated
