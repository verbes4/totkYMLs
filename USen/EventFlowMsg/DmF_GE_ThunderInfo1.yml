  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Link, I understand how you're feeling.
  
  
  Zelda is a dear friend to me as well. I will
  do everything in my power to help you.

  I'm sure you've noticed that the desert
  is even more difficult to cross than usual.

  I want to master this power so I can use it
  to defeat the Gibdos.
  
  If I can do that, we can investigate the
  source of this sand shroud and search for
  Zelda, as well!

  That's thanks to this unusual sand
  shroud. It appeared around the same time
  the events at Hyrule Castle took place.
  <4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003000'/>It has blanketed the whole desert,
  including our town.

  And not long after that, swarms of
  monsters we'd never seen before began
  attacking. We're calling them <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_05: |
  Physical attacks don't work well against
  them. They are slow,<5 Type='0'/> but they still make
  investigating the sand shroud difficult.

  Were you watching just now?

  <4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>So Hyrule Castle rose up into the sky,
  Zelda vanished right in front of you...
  
  and now you've come here looking
  for clues.

  over there with lightning...
  
  If I can aim the lightning well, I think it
  may be an effective weapon against
  the Gibdos.
Talk_01: |
  But to do that, I need to bring a quick
  resolution to a problem we Gerudo
  are facing...
Talk_08: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003000'/>But this technique is...unrefined. I only
  recently discovered it and still need
  more practice.
Talk_10: |
  I think I can use your arrows to help me
  aim my lightning strikes. Fire one at that
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>dummy<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> over there!
