  Though we Zora live long lives, this all happened in
  a time ancient even to us. The kingdom of Hyrule was
  still in its infancy.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_001_b: |
  A great evil, the Demon King, appeared. He invaded
  Hyrule and sought to cut the new kingdom's
  time short.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_002_b: |
  But Rauru—the first king of Hyrule—brought me
  and five other warriors together to oppose him.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_003_b: |
  Rauru entrusted us with the means to fight the
  Demon King.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_004_b: |
  Treasured artifacts called secret stones that amplify
  the power of those who carry them.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_005_b: |
  As the Sage of Water, I bore a secret stone and
  fought alongside my fellow sages in battle.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_006_b: |
  However, the Demon King's power was overwhelming.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_007_b: |
  Even my strongest defenses could not stop his
  ferocious attacks.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_010_b: |
  He chose to end the battle by sealing the Demon
  King away...sacrificing himself in the process.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_011_b: |
  So that was the Imprisoning War...
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_021_b: |
  I swear to you that, when the great evil returns,
  the Zora Sage of Water will awaken once more.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_022_b: |
  The Zora people and their sage will fight alongside
  your swordsman.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_004_c: |
  To fight the Demon King, Rauru entrusted us with
  secret stones.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_009_c: |
  In the end, our leader realized it would not be possible
  to defeat the Demon King outright.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_013_c: |
  The rest of us survived, and it was not long after that
  climactic battle that someone came to see me. Her
  visit would make the destiny of the Zora crystal clear.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_014_c: |
  It was another of the six sages—the Sage of Time.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_016_c: |
  The magic restraining the Demon King will eventually
  be undone.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_017_c: |
  When that happens, a noble swordsman, named Link,
  will oppose him.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_018_c: |
  We must help. Lend him your power... He will need
  the Zora's control over water!
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_019_c: |
  The course of the Zora's future was clear.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_020_c: |
  It would be our honor to aid in defeating the
  Demon King.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_004_d: |
  Treasured artifacts that amplify the power of those
  who carry them.
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_014_d: |
  Some time later...
Dm_ZO_0032_Text_014_e: |
  Another of the six sages—the Sage of Time—came to
  visit me, and the destiny of the Zora was made
  crystal clear.
