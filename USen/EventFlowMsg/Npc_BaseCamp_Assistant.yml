  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Now that I know fragments like this one
  can help us <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>see the Depths in a new way<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  I'll be searching my collection for more.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I'll let you know if that leads to a
  new breakthrough!<0 Type='4'/>Until then, you should probably focus on
  the investigations that Doc tasked you
  with, Swordsman!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> you took helped me realize
  this fragment here is going to help us
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>see the Depths in a new way<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>I'll look through my collection for more
  fragments, and I'll let you know if I have
  a breakthrough.
  Until then, focus on the investigations
  that Doc asked you to do!

  You looked like you were somewhere
  else just now.
  Oh, I bet you're interested in that
  strange stone, huh? <5 Type='1'/>We discovered
  it in the Depths.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It looks both naturally formed and as
  though it's been carved into...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>We don't know much about it, as you
  can probably tell. There's still so much
  to learn...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>So once I'm done with my current
  investigation, I plan to start digging
  into it more!
