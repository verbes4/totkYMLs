  receive visitors here.<0 Type='4'/>I assume you will require Zonai devices
  to descend the mountain. Would you like
  to use the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>device dispenser<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
talk_27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My maintenance is fully complete. You are
  free to use the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>device dispenser <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>anytime.
talk_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Do you require the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>device dispenser <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>or
  any <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai devices<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh. <5 Type='0'/>You have returned.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>My duties are complete. <5 Type='0'/>But I have not

talk_16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>There is a slight issue. <5 Type='0'/>You do not seem
  to have an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>It is impressive that you have come so far
  without one. <5 Type='0'/>Not everyone could do so.<0 Type='4'/>But an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> will be essential to
  traverse the rest of this island.
talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yes. I am manufacturing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai devices<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  using this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>device dispenser<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk_17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It seems that you still do not have an
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>You cannot make use of Zonai devices
  without an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Device dispensers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  will also not function for you.
talk_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Do you see the bowl-like receptacle?
  Resources held in your hands can be
  deposited there.<0 Type='4'/>It accepts resources such as <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>construct
  horns <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai charges <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for processing.
talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You also cannot use the Zonai devices

talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I see you are still here. <5 Type='0'/>I am ordinarily
  alone on this mountain. The conversation
  we are having is very exciting to me.
talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Let us speak again after you have

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>It is cold here. You can light a fire nearby
  to warm yourself if you plan to remain
  for long.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Oh. <5 Type='0'/>I remember you.
talk_30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My maintenance duties are complete for
  today. <5 Type='1'/>It has been another cycle with
  no visitors.
talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It is interesting to have a visitor after so
  long in isolation. <5 Type='0'/>I am happy to address
  whatever questions you have.

  The device dispenser.
talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>The altitude here is incredibly high. It is

  Zonai devices<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. They are useful tools for

  They are a portable form of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai device<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I recall the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Maker Construct <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>by the

  having a spare <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  Device dispenser?
talk_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We will speak again when you come into
  possession of an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk_22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Maker Construct <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>by the riverside at

0003: |
  I'm fine.
talk_23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh? <5 Type='0'/>You seem to have finally acquired an
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Energy Cell<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>This will enable you to use Zonai devices.<5 Type='0'/>
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Device dispensers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are now also available
  for your use.
talk_24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Pardon this late explanation. <5 Type='0'/>I prepare
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai devices<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> here that are useful for

talk_25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>device dispenser<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/><5 Type='0'/> can provide you

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My duties today are complete.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Do you see the bowl-like receptacle? Hold
