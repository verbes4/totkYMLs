  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Misko<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s the name of an infamous bandit
  who caused problems all over Hyrule back
  in the day.
  But Misko's legend expands beyond mere
  banditry. You see, Misko is equally famous
  for fashion.
  The stories say that they spent a lifetime
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>collecting clothes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—clothes that are now
  hidden across Hyrule.

  be in the caves that were exposed during
  the Upheaval.
  That's why we're here.
