  to him.
  So I've kinda been avoiding him
  altogether...
  
  I'm hoping to find some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ripened flint<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to offer him, by way of apology.
  It's his favorite.

  There are some in the caves around here,
  but the footholds collapsed, and they
  can't keep a steady supply coming.
  So if you find some, please bring it to me.
