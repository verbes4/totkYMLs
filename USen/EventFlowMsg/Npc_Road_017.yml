  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>It's just... <5 Type='1'/>I saw sunken treasure in a
  pond on the hill near <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ludfo's Bog<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Seems a shame to leave perfectly good
  treasure chests down there.<5 Type='0'/> I wonder if
  there's a way to lift them out...

  out on the horizon, huh?<5 Type='0'/> That's why they
  make such good landmarks!<0 Type='4'/>Though the sky islands are grander,
  of course. If ever I'm lost, I know I can
  look up at them to find my way.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>Is there some way to reach them?
  As a consummate traveler, I'd love to
  go up there just once...

  You know, there used to be an awful—
  and I mean awful—thunderstorm raging
  throughout this whole area.
  It never let up...<5 Type='0'/>until recently it did.
  Which is why I was able to come here.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Now that it's safer, maybe I should climb
  a tall tree and scope things out.

  When I'm traveling, I love to take in the
  sight of sky islands floating overhead.
GoRange_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Look at that structure.<5 Type='1'/> Gotta be...<5 Type='0'/>one of
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Towers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, right?<0 Type='4'/>It's big, that thing! I bet it'd be easy to
  spot from a distance.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Maybe I'll use it as a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>landmark<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> when
  I'm traveling.
  
  Always helps to have a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>landmark<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. That
  way, if you get mixed up, you can turn
  yourself the right way around!
RainPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you get too cold, it'll sap your strength
  and you won't be able to flee when you
  need to. Best not to be reckless.
GoRange_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>When I left on my journey, I used the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>as a landmark to keep
  track of my direction.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But down in this valley, I can't see it,
  so I'm getting all mixed up.
  
  If I could only scale the cliffs here,<5 Type='0'/> I'd be
  able to see the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and figure
  out which way to go.

  way to win this one!

Near_BackRange_01: |
  What can I do?
Near_BackRange_02: |
  It's so high up...

  worry about getting lost.

  Rain. Not my day.
Near_GoRange_01: |
  Just once, I wanna climb it.

  at all... <5 Type='0'/>It's eerie.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>If I could scale the cliffs, I'd be able to
  see them and the Skyview Towers again.
  Then I'd feel much better.
Near_GoRange_02: |
  It really stands out.
EnokidaSignboard: |
  Hudson Construction?

  I can't see them...

  It's been a long journey. I figured
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tabantha Bridge Stable <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>was a good
  place to stop and catch my breath.
  And with all the tall trees nearby, it was
  easy to spot from far away.

  You may be surprised to learn that before
  the Upheaval, this stable was more north.
  
  When the cold snap hit <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hebra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, business
  froze up and they had to relocate.
  
  I'm sure it's no accident they moved in
  next to a geoglyph. Good chance to make
  some dough off the sightseer crowd.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh! Word has it there's actually a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>giant
  monster <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>prowling around <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of
  the geoglyph.
  So if you're passing that way, be sure to
  keep an eye out.

StartPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There are lots of tall trees around here,

  It's always a good idea to make note of
