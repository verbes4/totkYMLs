  I've heard that these strange, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring-shaped

  I wonder if the voe of my destiny is among

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>There's an off chance that the voe of

  Though jokes aside, it does make

  Everyone seems busy investigating the

  I think I'll save my visit for another day.
