  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Actually, Buliara...
  
  
  I do have a small piece of information
  regarding Zelda.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I experienced a vision when I took the
  secret stone in my hand.
  
  The person that my ancestor referred
  to as the Sage of Time looked identical
  to Zelda.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_14: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Hmmm.
  
  
  My ancestor claimed to have been from
  the distant past.
  
  It's just not possible for Zelda to be in
  that era...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Hmm. Pay me no mind. I'm just thinking
  out loud.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>I hate to tell you this, but the attire you
  are wearing is...not acceptable.
  
  What I mean to say is...please put more
  on before coming into town.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're always welcome in town so long as
  you are dressed appropriately.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_05: |
  But it'd be impossible for that person to
  be Zelda...wouldn't it?
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_15: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Was that Zelda in the distant past? In the
  same era when my ancestor was alive?
  
  No, it's just not possible.
  
  
  After all, we saw someone who looked
  exactly like Zelda recently too.
  
  She vanished without saying a word, but
  that had to have been Zelda.
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Hmm...
  
  
  We're going to have to keep investigating
  if we want to find any answers...
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_06: |
  Could that person have been Zelda?
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_16: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Then the Zelda that was in the distant
  past... The one my ancestor knew...
  That's the real Zelda.
  The Zelda we saw has to be someone
  else. Things start to fit together if we
  assume that much is true.
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Hmmm... There's still more to investigate.
  We don't have enough information to
  be sure.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_07: |
  What if that was actually Zelda...
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_17: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>But it's impossible to deny that someone
  resembling Zelda has been spotted across
  Hyrule, and that terrible events follow her.
  The Zelda we know and the Zelda we saw
  in the vision of the distant past are
  incredibly similar.
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>If the Zelda in the past is our Zelda,
  then who is this other person?
  
  We must uncover her true identity.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a0055006e006400650072007300740061006e0064005f0030003000'/>I'm sorry, Link. Although the threat of the
  sand shroud and the Gibdos has passed...
  
  I cannot leave Gerudo Town at the
  moment. Things need some time to settle.
  
  However, we will take on the task of
  searching this area for any signs of Zelda.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_18: |
  I look forward to such a reunion.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_09: |
  Someone who just happens to look like
  Zelda... That doesn't explain everything
  that's been going on.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003000'/>Link... If you are planning on traveling to
  the other regions in your investigation,
  why don't you visit Lookout Landing?
  Hmm? You aren't familiar with
  Lookout Landing?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>My understanding is that those concerned
  with Princess Zelda's whereabouts and
  other recent events are gathering there.
  Last I heard, Lookout Landing was
  being constructed just south of Hyrule
  Castle. Why don't you try heading there?
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Link... You said you had already
  visited Rito Village, Goron City, and
  Zora's Domain...
  Hmm. I'm sure Lookout Landing would
  welcome any information you could share.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>Hmm? You aren't familiar with

  I am grateful to you for helping me save
  the Gerudo.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>Link... You said you had already

  I'm sure Lookout Landing would value
  any information you could share. Why not
  go there and see if you can help?

  <4 Type='0' Data='16004700720065006500740069006e0067005f0030003000'/>I hope your travels bring you back here
  again, Link.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>I've received reports that ever since the
  sand shroud dissipated, Gibdo attacks
  have almost entirely stopped.

  but it is thanks to your help that we can
  live on the surface again.

  I will still be able to support you. <5 Type='1'/>I swear
  that I will do anything I can to help!
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_13: |
  On behalf of all the Gerudo people,
  thank you.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='1400540072006f00750062006c0065005f0030003000'/>I am sorry to say, though, that despite the
  safety of Gerudo Town no longer being a
  pressing concern...
  we still haven't been able to uncover any
  information on the whereabouts of
  Princess Zelda.
Dm_GE_GrandFinale_23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>I hate to tell you this, but the attire you
  are wearing is...not acceptable.
  
  What I mean to say is...I would ask you to
  not dress as an enemy.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're wearing an item identical to what
  a group that regularly attacks us wears.
  
  You may return when you are
  dressed appropriately.
