  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Our task was to scavenge food in this
  area, but we just saw a flock of monsters
  fly past outside the cave.<0 Type='4'/>The same ones that have been sighted

  away to report them, but Tulin clearly
  wasn't listening at all.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>He said, "I'm gonna follow them back to
  their nest," and flew off alone before I
  could protest.

  Peak. That's where we saw the monsters.<0 Type='4'/>No doubt Tulin followed them there.

  really shouldn't be taking these chances.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Well, I'll be! What is a Hylian doing all the
  way up here in such a fierce blizzard?
