  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>Look...<5 Type='0'/> See how this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has
  fallen into the wall?
  
  These statues are typically set in rows
  with one sight line leading to the next
  until they finally stop at an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>old mine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But this is different. This chain of statues
  ends here.<5 Type='0'/> I've looked all over, but there's
  no sign of an old mine.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Could it somehow be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>inside this wall<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  But I don't see any kind of entrance.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Normally, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone statues <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>like these are
  arranged in a row leading to an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>old mine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  But this row doesn't lead anywhere.<5 Type='0'/>
  I've looked all over, but there's no sign
  of an old mine.
  <4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>If there's no way to get <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>inside the wall<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  maybe it's just a misplaced set of statues.
  Still, it's weird...
talk_1043: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s the same as the others,
  right?<5 Type='0'/> The ones that lead to an
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>abandoned mine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  But this row...ends here.<5 Type='0'/> I've looked all
  over, but there's no sign of an old mine.
