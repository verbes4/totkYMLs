  Anyway, the strange voice can only be

  Hey, partner?<5 Type='0'/> Do you get goosebumps?
  You're not a Rito, but I'm curious if you
  feel it too...
  Ah, never mind. That's not what matters
  right now.
  
  What is important is that we look into this

  you head out, OK?

  M-my legs won't move! <5 Type='1'/>My w-wings won't

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Hmm, we can't hear the voice anymore.
  It seems like the time of day has some
  significance...
  We don't know where the voice is coming
  from or what's causing it, but at least
  we're safe.
  For now, all we can do is resume our
  investigation at nightfall, partner.

  folks have heard a voice near here that
  sounds like Princess Zelda.
  I heard the chirps and warbles from my
  little birds and headed straight here, but
  something is fishy...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>For starters, the strange voice is crowing
  from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Fural Plain to the northwest<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, night
  after night after night.
  "Leave the...rms... <5 Type='0'/>Leave the...rms..."
  
  
  At least, that's what I heard. I didn't get
  too close.

  eerie voice have gotten spooked by it!
  
  They've been throwing their weapons
  down the well and then running away as
  fast as they can.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Could the voice really belong to Princess
  Zelda? She's not usually so...haunting.
  
  All we can do is seek out the truth,
  partner! Even if it is a little scary...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800530075007200700072006900730065004d005f0030003000'/>It's just someone, er, singing in a well?
  She's just practicing?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Huh... I see...
  
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>And her voice echoed off the well walls,
  making it sound like the princess's voice.
  Acoustics are strange...
  And that same distortion made the lyrics
  she was singing sound more like threats
  to everyone who heard her.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068004c00'/>Ha! So the mystery is solved! <5 Type='0'/> Now I know
  why I had all those goosebumps! I sensed
  one heck of a story coming my way!
  Thanks for your help, partner!

  Hm. I guess the only way to find out is to

Challenge_0072: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>OK, I'll head on back to the office and

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>What I'm saying is I think we should

  What's going on? Tell me everything!
Challenge_0006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Just give me a shout before you head out!<5 Type='0'/>
