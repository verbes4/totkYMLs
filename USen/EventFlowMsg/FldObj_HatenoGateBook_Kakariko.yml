  While Tauro and I were taking a break, he
  asked me, "Hey, Calip, what attracted you
  to join the Zonai Survey Team?"<0 Type='4'/>A little flustered, I answered that I heard
  its research division was led by a brilliant
  man by the name of Tauro.<0 Type='4'/>Because of you, essentially.<0 Type='4'/>I meant it sincerely, and in my heart,
  I longed to continue...<0 Type='4'/>"You're not like these other dullards, you
  know. You immediately grasp the breadth
  of my vision."<0 Type='4'/>Of course, no such thing passed my lips.<0 Type='4'/>But I am certain that Tauro, and no one
  else, is the man who can help the world
  see my indescribable worth.

  Our leader Tauro has done nothing
  but surprise me since I joined the
  Zonai Survey Team.<0 Type='4'/>One day, I arrived at the research site to
  find him sitting on bare earth as he stared
  at a stone slab.<0 Type='4'/>I wished him a good morning, and to that
  he turned to me and said...<0 Type='4'/>"Ah, Calip. Sorry I didn't notice you.
  Working overtime today, huh?"<0 Type='4'/>I thought back to the night before. As I
  was heading in, I saw Tauro sitting on
  bare earth, examining a stone slab.<0 Type='4'/>It hit me then—he had stayed up all
  through the night puzzling over the
  slab, never moving from his perch.<0 Type='4'/>I felt a profound envy of his ability to
  focus so completely that the passing of
  time escaped his notice.

  It's a researcher's duty to use his wisdom
  and intuition to bring to light historical
  truths which the ruins would keep secret.<0 Type='4'/>We carry on the work of our forebears and
  continue our pursuit tirelessly, then pass
  what we learn to those who come after.<0 Type='4'/>Our leader Tauro understands well that
  this is not a task that can be completed
  in a single generation.<0 Type='4'/>He says this is why he wants to make so
  many discoveries, even if the credit to
  whom they belong is lost.<0 Type='4'/>That's the sort of man Tauro is. But I,
  Dr. Calip, won't be so easily satisfied.<0 Type='4'/>My discoveries will be noteworthy, to be
  sure, but it is my name that I want to live
  on forever.<0 Type='4'/>Not just in peoples' memories, but in
  books, stone tablets, and—if I might be
  a trifle immodest—landmarks!<0 Type='4'/>Calip Valley, Calip River, the Calip Hills...
  My dreams recognize no boundaries!
                                                  -Dr. Calip
