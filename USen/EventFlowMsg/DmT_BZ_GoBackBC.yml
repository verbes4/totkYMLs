  You see...
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_009_c: |
  You cannot hope to escape your fate.

DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_010_b: |
  My power will sweep across this land.
  You need but await the inevitable end.

  Was that the Demon King we were warned
  about? It all really happened?!
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_013_b: |
  This is dire. The Demon King...the man
  who nearly destroyed the world.
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_014_b: |
  Ganondorf!
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_015_b: |
  With his return, everyone's in danger.
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_016_b: |
  Oh, this isn't good! If that really was
  him... Oh, we're in real trouble!
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_017_b: |
  Hold on... He must not be at his full
  strength. Otherwise, why flee instead
  of finishing us off?
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_018_b: |
  We should return to Lookout Landing and
  decide what to do next.
DmT_BZ_GoBackBC_Text_019_b: |
  Link, you should come too.
