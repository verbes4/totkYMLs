  stop? Seriously...
  
  I've been investigating ruins in intense
  daytime heat and freezing cold nights,
  and it's done a number on my skin.
  I took some time off to go visit the spa...

  I came out here to investigate the ruins

  But this intense daytime heat and the cold
  nights have messed with my skin, so I
  figured I'd take some time off at the spa.
