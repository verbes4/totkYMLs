  Extraordinary Elixirs?

  Fairies?

  Most ingredients can imbue their meals
  with some unique effects.
  
  Ingredients that have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cold<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> properties
  can help you resist heat.
  
  Ingredients that have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hearty<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> properties
  can fully heal you and grant you
  temporary bonus vitality!
  There are many other effects to be found
  among ingredients. You just have to
  experiment!
  And don't forget! Combining ingredients
  with the same effect may increase the
  effect's strength or duration...
  But combining ingredients with different
  effects may cancel their enhancing
  effects out, so you must be careful.
  I, Aurie Taamu, am admittedly quite
  impatient, so I always have speed-
  increasing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hasty foods<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on hand!

  That's enough.

  You can cook up an elixir by mixing a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>critter part<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster part<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> together.
  
  Elixirs can be made in pots, just like
  food, and with valuable ingredients,
  the elixir's effect will get stronger!
  You can also add <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>acorns<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chickaloo
  tree nuts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to impart your elixir with minor
  healing properties.
  However... I, Aurie Taamu, am deathly
  afraid of critters and would never even
  think of touching them.
  Fortunately, there are regular meals that
  you can cook which will produce the same
  effects as elixirs.

  Sometimes you'll witness incredible
  success in your cooking adventures.
  
  When this happens, the strength and
  duration of your cooked food's effects
  will increase well beyond normal.
  Using more than the usual number of
  ingredients is a sure way to boost the
  effects of your food.
  But I've also heard rumors that the light
  of the red moon can have a positive
  effect on your cooking as well.
  I haven't checked this myself though.
  I get sleepy in the evenings, so I've
  never even seen the red moon.

  It is said that fairies truly do exist in the
  world, but that they will only appear
  before an individual with a pure soul.
  One theory suggests that some special
  kind of cooking might be possible if you
  used the power of a fairy...
  I, Aurie Taamu, have been a pure soul
  for over 35 years. I expect my fairy will
  arrive any day now...

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Monster extract<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is an ingredient that
  boosts the effects of any dish that it has
  been added to.
  With just one <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster extract<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you can
  raise the power and duration of the
  effects of your dish.
  However, you never really know
  quite how the dish will turn out.
  
  Sometimes it will raise the effect by a lot,
  and other times... Well, not so much.
  
  However, I, Aurie Taamu, am not a man
  who relies solely on luck!
talk0008: |
  There are many in the world who will
  gladly pay for the dishes a chef creates!
  
  A cooked meal can easily sell for more
  than the individual components you
  used to make it.
  And don't forget, the more ingredients
  you pour into a meal, the greater the
  value of that meal! That's basic math!
  Did I learn all this from experience? No,
  of course not! I learned it from a friend!
  A dear friend! Who was a great chef!
  I can't recall his name right now, but he
  was a friend, to be sure!
