  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I wanted to see with my own eyes what
  I had previously only read of in books.
  
  That was why I ceded my position as chief
  and left with Cado.
  
  Poor Paya. She was shocked to have
  the mantle of leadership thrust upon her
  so suddenly.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>But I knew that within her lay the seeds
  of a capable chief.
  
  All those seeds needed was a chance
  to grow.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Now Paya is firmly on her own path as the
  leader of the village.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>To see my granddaughter learning to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>decipher the Zonai language<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>... It is a
  delight, if certainly not a surprise.
  And it means that I can rest easy in
  my retirement.
Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You have caught glimpses of Princess
  Zelda's memories...
  
  That certainly seems as though it must be
  an omen of some kind.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The village is now in Paya's hands
  as chief, so I can pour over the
  literature freely.
  You ought to devote your efforts to
  calming the effects of the Upheaval.
Talk_16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So... Link...
TerrorEnemy_00: |
  Away from me!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800530075007200700072006900730065004c005f0030003000'/>Ah. I see that you are wearing the attire of
  the ancient hero.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>How amusing. <5 Type='0'/>You almost look like that
  figure depicted on the screen...
TerrorEnemy_01: |
  I dropped my guard...
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>...But first, you should at least put a
  shirt on.
TerrorEnemy_02: |
  If only I was younger...
TerrorImpulse_00: |
  W-watch out!
TerrorHorse_00: |
  Keep your distance!
Talk_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>And Link... We may be old friends, but I
  still expect you to show respect in the
  chief's hall.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0200'/>Would you at least put a shirt on?
TerrorImpulse_01: |
  Not so close!
TerrorHorse_01: |
  Settle down!
Talk_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>And Link... I will remind you this village
  has a history with the Yiga Clan.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0200'/>So please, stop this tasteless prank, and
  put something else on!
TerrorImpulse_02: |
  What is it?!
TerrorHorse_02: |
  Stop the horse!
TerrorSword_00: |
  Enough of that!
TerrorSword_01: |
  The joke has gone too far!
TerrorSword_02: |
  Settle down!

  to find you in good health.
  
  I only just came back to the village myself.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I have been thinking of those glimpses
  you had of the Light Dragon's—or rather,
  Princess Zelda's—memories.
  It seems as though that must be an omen
  of some kind.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The village is now in Paya's hands as
  chief, so I intend to keep looking for a
  way to restore the princess.
  You ought to devote your efforts to
  calming the effects of the Upheaval.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Perhaps you recognize what is shown
  on that screen.
0002: |
  The Calamity?
TerrorBomb_01: |
  Wh-what are you up to?
0003: |
  Goodbye.
Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>That reminds me. Purah left a
  journal here.
  
  But where did I put it?
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>She told me to hide the thing. Perhaps I
  followed her instructions too well.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>I managed to conceal it from myself.
TerrorBomb_02: |
  I detect ill intent...
TerrorInsect: |
  Away from me!
TerrorFire_00: |
  The joke has gone too far!
TerrorFire_01: |
  Hot!
Enokida_00: |
  I still see your foot.
TerrorFire_02: |
  Hot, hot, hot!
TerrorFlash_00: |
  Not at me!
Enokida_01: |
  What are you doing?
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link. You are here early.
TerrorFlash_01: |
  Enough of that!
Enokida_02: |
  Enjoying yourself?
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link. You are here.
TerrorArrow_00: |
  Enough of that!
TerrorFlash_02: |
  You must stop this!
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link. You chose a late hour to
  drop by.
TerrorArrow_01: |
  Wh-what are you up to?
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link. Isn't it raining outside?
  And still you came.
TerrorArrow_02: |
  I detect ill intent...
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The Calamity was the Demon King of
  ancient times, brought back to existence
  in the form of hatred manifest.
  Some of our youths believe the Calamity
  to be mere legend. You and I know better,
  of course.
  Shown here are the royal princess with
  the power to seal away evil...<5 Type='0'/>and a warrior
  chosen by a legendary sword.
  This image depicts how, using four
  relics called Divine Beasts built by our
  ancestors, they drove off the Calamity.
TerrorGeneric_00: |
  I detect ill intent...
TerrorExplosion_00: |
  No matter.
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>It is a part of our history which must never
  be forgotten—the Calamity.
TerrorGeneric_01: |
  What is it?!
TerrorExplosion_01: |
  Enough of that!
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>That reminds me. Symin told me he is
  teaching the children at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno School<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lesson about the Calamity<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  The school is in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, not far from here.
  
  Why not drop by and take the
  lesson yourself?
TerrorGeneric_02: |
  Hm?
TerrorExplosion_02: |
  Oof...
TerrorLightning: |
  Lightning?!
TerrorAnimal: |
  Away from me!
