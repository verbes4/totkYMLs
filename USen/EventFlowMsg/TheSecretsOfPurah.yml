  I grew frustrated with being treated like a
  child, so I resumed my age-booster
  experimentations in earnest.
  The anti-aging device reversed more than
  100 years in an instant, so I reflected on
  that result and moderated the output.
  When I cautiously exposed myself to its
  rays, I returned to my 20-year-old form,
  just as I had hoped. Success!
  I'm so happy that I can once again reach
  high places without using a jetpack.
  
  My 20-year-old body doesn't suffer from
  sleepless nights researching. And what's
  more, my skin is perfect. No complaints!

  Read Purah's diary?
Comment_06: |
  I've decided to store this diary in four
  volumes. That way, if a nosy someone
  reads it, they'll only have a quarter of it.
  Such ideas are the fruits of genius!
  As for the first one...I think I'll entrust
  it to...who else but Impa.

  Speaking of Impa, she's had a cute habit
  of hiding important items underneath
  things ever since she was a child.
  I have a fond memory of when she forgot
  about a hidden steamed bun beneath a
  cushion and then sat on it. Squashed flat!
  Diaries are flat to begin with, but as they
  are more important than a bun, I hope she
  finds a better hiding spot than a cushion.

  I haven't decided where to hide three of
  my four diary volumes yet. Hmm.
Comment_14: |
  It seems like a good idea to hide one of
  them away in my own room...
Comment_20: |
  The lab there is perfect for hiding things.
  It's such a remote location, I'm sure no
  one will ever come across it!

  I've been at Lookout Landing a lot lately.
  Maybe I should go back to the lab in
  Hateno Village to place the diary.
Comment_16: |
  I've decided where to hide the second
  volume of my diary. For the last two
  spots, maybe I'll shoot arrows at a map.
Comment_17: |
  Update: Genius doesn't translate to being
  good with a bow. I ended up piercing the
  floor instead of the map.
  I'll just leave one volume here at Lookout
  Landing, as indicated by the arrows.

  Read.

  A stairway leading deep beneath
  Hyrule Castle has been discovered.
  
  Even Princess Zelda didn't know about it,
  so it seems safe to assume it's a secret
  removed even from royal legend.
  We have confirmed that gloom emanates
  from that location, meaning something
  down there must be causing it.
  I appointed Princess Zelda and Link
  to investigate.
  
  Actually... It would be more accurate to
  say that Princess Zelda volunteered for
  the job before I had the chance.
  I know beyond a doubt there is no team
  more qualified for such a task, and yet...
  I can't escape this feeling of dread.

  Don't read.

  Perhaps it's a side effect of returning to
  my previous form from 100 years ago,
  but I had a dream about that time.
  Back then, Robbie and I did whatever we
  pleased at the Royal Ancient Lab...
  
  Age-reversal-experimentation explosions.
  Warping-failure explosions. Explosion-
  prevention-device explosions.
  I recall us trying things that likely would
  have gotten us tossed out if Impa and
  Princess Zelda hadn't covered for us.
  Impa scolded me often, but never too
  harshly. Those were fun times.

  Three volumes of my diary are hidden
  away now. I'll place the last one at the
  northeastern edge of Akkala.

  I designed the Purah Pad to be capable of
  various experiments in hopes of carrying
  some of the burden for Hyrule's recovery.
  Robbie built a prototype right away,
  and we asked the princess to use it
  in her work across Hyrule.
  Princess Zelda learned quickly and was
  quite delighted to capture test pictures
  with the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> was intended for use in
  investigations, but it's possible it could
  also be useful in everyday life.
  Perhaps after the recovery, a time will
  come when everyone has their very own
  Purah Pad. Hee-hee, just imagine!
