  Zelda asked me to aid you, Link.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_004_d: |
  I must thank you.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_000_ab: |
  
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_007_b: |
  In the name of Mineru, Sage of Spirit, I grant my
  power unto you.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_009_c: |
  With this power I've given, a deep bond has been
  forged between us.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_000_aaaab: |
  
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_003_b: |
  I am glad to meet you, Link.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_012_b: |
  And from this point forward, my spirit will reside within
  that construct. I will help you however I can.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_d: |
  It is because of you that we have recovered my
  secret stone.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_001_c: |
  I am the Sage of Spirit and one of the Zonai.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_e: |
  Originally, my intent was to awaken when you first
  found the Purah Pad...
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_f: |
  then to guide you to my construct and assist you on
  your journey. I had not anticipated a battle with that
  same construct...
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_005_g: |
  You have proven quite adept, and I am grateful for
  all your efforts.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_006_b: |
  Link...here.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_008_c: |
  I believe it will serve you well.
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_000_aab: |
  
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_006_c: |
  
Dm_ZN_0030_Text_002_b: |
  Mineru.
