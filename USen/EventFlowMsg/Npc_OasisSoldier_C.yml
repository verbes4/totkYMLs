  the Gibdos with my spear, but I hardly left
  a scratch!
  They're incredibly hardy, and their
  numbers...<5 Type='0'/> If we don't pick them off
  fast, they'll surround and wipe us out!
  But if we want to win...

  You wanna throw down?!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I attached an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Electric Lizalfos horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to my
  spear like another guard suggested, but...
  
  I don't know. This seems like such a
  simple solution. Is it really going to be
  the key to defeating the Gibdos?
  Well, we can't know for sure until we try.
  Nothing we've done so far has been the
  answer, anyway.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There are many different kinds of
  monsters that roam the Gerudo Desert.
  
  There is one, though, that is gigantic!
  It's a fierce creature known as a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Molduga<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Even for us Gerudo, a Molduga is a
  dangerous opponent. We usually attack in
  numbers, yet the battle is always tough.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But once I've finished my training, beating
  one will be as easy as taking honey candy
  from a vehvi!
  First, I'll draw the attention of a Molduga
  with something that makes sound. They
  have famously <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sensitive hearing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, after all.
  And then, once it comes to the surface,
  I'll launch a full-on attack! What do you
  think? Perfect plan, am I right?

Talk22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I just...<5 Type='0'/>need to do a bit more training
  before I can take one on.
ThunderHelmet: |
  I recognize that helm...

  Take that!
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You showed off some really impressive
  abilities with your bow during the battle.
  
  I can't imagine how much training you've
  endured to become so skilled.
  
  Really, this whole event has revealed how
  much more I could do to improve myself!
Talk14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Do you need something from me? As you
  can see, I'm busy training right now.
  
  Once I've trained just a bit more...
Talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Until now, I always thought that you
  could get through a fight with skill and
  strength alone...
  But it seems like my way of thinking is a
  bit out of date. Some folks are fighting
  with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>modified weapons<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  I never realized what else could turn the
  tide of a battle.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>That said! <5 Type='1'/>Weapons aren't everything. A
  well-equipped army of greenhorns can still
  fall to experienced opponents!
  Training is just as important as ever!
Talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Then I'm planning to go defeat a Molduga.
  You know, the monster of the desert!
  
  Training is good, but actual experience in
  battle is even more important!
