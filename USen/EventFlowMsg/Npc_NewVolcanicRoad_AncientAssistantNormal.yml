  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Our regular clothing stayed dry when we

  Not a good look, though, was it?

  have a legendary look.
  I hear Misko hid a piece in a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> nearby.
  Personally, I suspect it might be in the
  cliffs of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dueling Peaks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Getting clothes wet ruins their fit.<5 Type='0'/> Rain
  really is the bane of fashion.
  
  Maybe our underpants outfits that we
  formerly wore would endure this weather
  far better.

  Is something there?

  The bridge...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Oh!<5 Type='0'/> It's you! The master of underpants
  excellence.<5 Type='0'/> The one who showed us all
  how to achieve more, wearing less.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Thanks for your help with all that. What?<5 Type='0'/>
  My new outfit?<0 Type='4'/>I've always been a stylish personâ€”a
  real cutting-edge sort, not to toot my
  own horn.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I joined the Zonai Survey Team purely
  because I thought their outfit was so
  unfashionable that it'd BE fashionable.
  But that whole underpants debacle
  made me realize I'm not cut out to be
  a surveyor of ruins.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068004c00'/>See? I have reinvented myself yet again.
  Unfashionable fashion is so last year
  anyway. True chic never goes out of style.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Now, I'm looking for a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>certain thing <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>near
  here that I think would make quite a
  fashion statement. So I hope.
  I'm also the sole person looking for it,
  and that makes me...<5 Type='1'/>the one and only
  member of the Fashion Survey Team!
Greeting: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ah, if it isn't the purveyor of
  underpants excellence!
  
  Incredible that Hyrule is so full of paths,
  yet ours continue to cross.
  
  Ah, the fashionable life truly is a
  rewarding one!
Greeting_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>At least, that's what I'd like to
  tell myself...
StartPoint_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>A ruin big enough to crush a bridge...
  Which <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky island <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>could it've fallen from?
  
  I have a feeling that sky island might hold
  the key to unlocking some of our history's
  greatest mysteries...
Greeting_02: |
  Now, above all else, <5 Type='0'/>I seek the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>treasures<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  hidden across Hyrule by the fashion
  pioneer<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> Misko<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
StartPoint_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>No, no, no! No more thinking about ruins!
  
  
  I walked all the way to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dueling Peaks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to find legendarily fashionable clothes!
  I'm here for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Misko's treasure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, not history!
  I intend to use my Zonai Survey Team
  skills to find those clothes, and
  nothing else!
GoRange_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There should be a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> near here where
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>treasure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is hidden. <5 Type='1'/>Personally, I believe
  it's in the cliffs of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dueling Peaks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
GoalPoint_01: |
  Hmm...<5 Type='1'/> I don't know what it is, but
  something about those ruins intrigues me.
BackRange_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Some bandits take jewels, but <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Misko <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>took
  highly fashionable clothes! One piece of
  their treasure is hidden in a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>nearby.
  I'm really curious, but I can't see the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Please don't tell me it's at the top
  of the cliff.
BackRange_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>I'm certain the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>treasure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is in a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  around here, <5 Type='0'/>but surely it can't be at
  the top of the cliff!
GoalPoint_02: |
  Those ruins have something inside of
  them.<5 Type='0'/> Might it be...<5 Type='1'/>a monster?
Near_RainPoint_01: |
  Underpants had their use...
Near_Thunder: |
  Take shelter!
Near_Rain: |
  My clothes will get wet!
Near_GoRange_01: |
  That cliff is suspicious.
