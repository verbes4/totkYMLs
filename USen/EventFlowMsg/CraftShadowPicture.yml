  Before I imparted my words of guidance?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Well. That makes me feel rather

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Your skill is impressive.<5 Type='0'/> Have you
  considered taking part in the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>dive ceremony<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  You should participate if you have not
  done so.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>The dive ceremony is a test of bravery
  that young Zonai must pass in order to be
  considered adults.
  You can earn a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>special outfit <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>as proof of
  your maturity by clearing the trial.
  
  But this island is not where it takes place.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>My task is to guide visitors here to the
  sacred shrine by conveying this message:
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>"Dye the white pattern black when the
  sun awakens in the sky. Then will the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The dive ceremony is held on three
  sky islands.
  
  One <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north of Central Hyrule Sky<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  
  
  another <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>west of Central Hyrule Sky<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>I have no doubt you will be able to pass
  the trials on all three islands and thereby
  obtain the outfit.
  Please do so when you have time.
Near0000: |
  I have information.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>The shrine will appear when you unlock
  the true meaning of these words.
