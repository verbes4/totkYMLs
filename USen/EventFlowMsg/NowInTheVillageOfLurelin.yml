  You see, our hometown is a place called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's a fishing village on the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeastern edge <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of Hyrule.
  It's a small place, but our little village
  had specialty shops you can't find
  anywhere else.
  People would travel great distances
  just to visit the shops. It was a very
  lively place...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>But then it was attacked by pirates.
