  early in the morning?
1003: |
  Goodbye.
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What do you need?<5 Type='0'/> Are you looking
  for someone?
talk0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I finally have the peace of mind to be able
  to relax and get a good night's sleep.
  Please, let me sleep just a bit longer...
near0000: |
  I can't believe they lost...
talk0003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>I hear you took part in the effort to
  repel those Gibdo things that were
  attacking the town.<5 Type='0'/> Sarqso...
  But it's not over yet, is it?

  again. I'm not going to miss the sand
  shroud one bit.
  I've heard all there is to hear about
  what happened. You were involved,
  weren't you?
  The chief must've foreseen what was
  going to happen early on. That would
  explain why she invited you here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>She was only a vehvi when I was in charge
  of protecting her predecessor.
  
  But sometime between then and now, she
  grew into the best vai among all of us.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>It looks like maybe, <5 Type='0'/>just maybe, <5 Type='0'/>this old
  soldier might just be able to finally relax...
1004: |
  Training area?
talk0017: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey. Don't even think about looking down
  on our noble guards, understand?
  
  Not only have they adapted to a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brand-new training regimen<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>â€”one
  focused on mobility...
  but they dove straight into battle without
  hesitation against the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. <5 Type='0'/>They have
  nothing if not their pride.
talk0004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There's been talk of the new training
  regimen getting started again once the
  sand shroud clears up.
  I need to come up with something to help
  revitalize our noble guards...
talk0018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I've only heard about it secondhand,
  but the guards have been training hard
  to improve their desert mobility.
  You see, <5 Type='0'/>some time ago,<5 Type='0'/> right when <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady
  Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> had become chief...
  
  Gerudo Town faced a major crisis.
  
  
  After it was resolved, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> swore that
  our military forces would be prepared to
  face any new threats that came along.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Unfortunately, that was a tougher task
  than anyone thought.<5 Type='1'/> Luckily, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s
  close friend Princess Zelda came to visit.
  The princess suggested that the Gerudo
  learn to be more in touch with the
  desert itself.
  This inspired <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and she proposed
  a new training regimen. At least, that's
  what I heard.
near0002: |
  What're they fighting over?
talk0019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I don't want to see any more injured
  people in need of care. <5 Type='1'/>That includes
  you, so be careful.
near0004: |
  If I wasn't retired...
talk0030: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200570061006b006500750070005f0030003000'/>What?
talk0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ugh, they are so loud. What could Pokki
  be refusing to drop this time...
  
  It's none of my business, really. Just an
  old habit...
  
  When I was an active guard, I had to be
  aware of everything that was going on.
  It's a tough habit to break.
talk0009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The soldiers are all restless and ready to
  get back to the training regimen now that
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>training area<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is open again.
  I understand though. The recent events
  were pretty rough on everyone, and they
  want to be ready for what comes next.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>If I wasn't retired, I'd be right there with
  them. "In the vanguard," so to speak.
talk0032: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have
  helped against those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> things.
talk0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are strange monsters.
  
  
  Our spears didn't even scratch them when
  the guards tried to fight.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I can't think of a time where monsters as
  ferocious as these prowled the desert...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Even with the new training regimen the
  troops went through, these monsters are
  too tough.
  Brute force won't help much if you run
  into them. Be clever. Better yet, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>think up
  some kind of new weapon to fight them<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk0033: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey... Isn't Kara Kara Bazaar in trouble
  right now? Were you planning on heading
  there, by chance?
talk0034: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Are you planning to go? I ask because I'm
  tired of caring for the injured, so...
  
  Be careful.
talk0035: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you want, you could go chat with
  Sudrey. She should be up at the barracks,
  I believe.
talk0023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>In case you're wondering, the soldiers all
  went to face the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Despite them being elite soldiers who
  completed the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new training regimen<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  some still aren't healed from the last fight.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I'd have jumped in if I were still on active
  duty, but all I can do nowadays is wait
  and pray for their safe return...
talk0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I understand that you are free to make
  use of whatever you find around here.
  
  If you get hungry, you can use the
  cooking pot to prepare something.
talk0036: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're interested in checking it out,
  it's located <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>south<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of town.
  
  Be aware though... It's right in the middle
  of the harsh desert, so make sure you're
  prepared before you head out there.
talk0000: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Not even the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new training regimen <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>could
  prepare our noble guards for all the
  recent events...
  What's going to happen the next time
  those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> things show up?
1001: |
  A training regimen?
talk0013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>...<0 Type='4'/>Sav'saaba...<5 Type='0'/> What do you need from me at
  this hour?
