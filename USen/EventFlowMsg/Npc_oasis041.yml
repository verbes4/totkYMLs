  an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>electricity-emitting material<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, but...
  
  Honestly, I think attaching something like
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>horn from a Fire-Breath Lizalfos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is
  better, at least on a sword or knife.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Since I'm not using a spear, I have to get
  in close to attack. At first I figured it'd
  be too dangerous, but with this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  Well, I didn't think a combination of sword
  and shield would work so well!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ha! Did you see my swordsmanship?
  
  
  I had thought that nothing could ever
  beat a spear, but now that I've used a
  sword and shield... I'm a little torn!
  What other weapons are out there that
  I've just dismissed out of hand?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The battle definitely taught me how
  important it is to learn about the many
  different weapons in the world.
  You really made good use of your bow, for
  example. <5 Type='1'/>As soon as I've mastered the
  sword and shield, maybe I'll try that...

  Hah!
