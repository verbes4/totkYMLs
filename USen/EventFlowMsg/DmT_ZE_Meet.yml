  My name is Rauru. King Rauru of Hyrule.
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_012_b: |
  We didn't mean to startle you.
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_002_bbb: |
  What?
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_014_b: |
  I'm sorry.
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_025_c: |
  
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_027_b: |
  But that must meanâ€”

DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_016_c: |
  
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_018_b: |
  And could we ask what your name is?

  Where am I?
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_022_c: |
  You two founded Hyrule? And you're the king?

DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_024_c: |
  King Rauru...and Queen Sonia?
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_002_c: |
  
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_004_b: |
  
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_015_c: |
  It's OK. My name is Sonia.
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_006_b: |
  
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_019_b: |
  I-I am...the daughter of King Rhoam of Hyrule. Zelda.
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_008_b: |
  
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_002_bd: |
  Oh! Oh dear!
DmT_ZE_Meet_Text_021_b: |
  What an unexpected answer. We are the king and
  queen who founded Hyrule, after all. Or at least we
  were the last time I checked.
