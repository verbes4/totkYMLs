  Thinking about what would happen if they

  Stable Association yet?
  
  If you use stables, then you should
  absolutely be registered. That's how
  you get a Pony Points card!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Head on over to the counter to get set up,
  then come back and talk to me.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>In that case, I'll add two points for you

  those monsters.
Text1007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><FontSize Value='80'/>Just how long are they going to stay there...
  
  
  And they may have spotted us spying on them from

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I've been trying to find someone to go

  has refused to help.
  It seems that kind of skill and confidence

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>Anyway,<5 Type='0'/> do you see the big tree

  you can probably see the monsters.
  
  It's an intimidating sight, to be sure.
Text1039: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh... Hang on... You're already carrying
  a ton of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>endura carrots<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Well, I still want to give you this. Just let
  me know when you've got some room
  for it!
Near1003: |
  Now I can relax.
Text1010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Everyone keeps saying not to worry, that
  they won't come all the way to the stable.<5 Type='0'/>
  But I'm not so sure.
  I don't think I'll really be able to relax
  until those monsters are gone for good.
Text1030: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>We wouldn't stand a chance against
  those monsters if they decided to attack
  this stable.
  Maybe I should look for a job somewhere
  else? South Akkala Stable might have
  some openings...
Text1040: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, are you back to collect your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>endura carrot <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>from me?
  
  Hmm. You still don't have any room.
  Well, that's fine. Just come talk to me
  when you've got some space!
Text1041: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ah, you've made some space? Then
  here's the promised <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>endura carrot<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  H-hold on a second!<5 Type='0'/> It's not that I don't

  I can't believe it! There were so many
  monsters before, but now they're gone!
Text1013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you want to see what I'm talking about,
  you can take a look over the edge by
  that tree.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I can't imagine why monsters would be
  settling on <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>North Akkala Beach<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of all
  places, and I can't stop worrying about it.
  I thought maybe I could build a barricade
  on the road down from the stable...
  
  Who am I kidding though? If a group that
  big decided to head this way, there would
  be no stopping them.
Text1043: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Well, you're just amazing!
  
  
  I'm sorry, I'm just so surprised.<5 Type='0'/> I mean,
  you don't look all that strong...
  
  But you've been such a huge help! I can
  already feel the stress those monsters
  caused leaving my body. Thank you!
  Hey, that reminds me. Do you have a
  Pony Points card?
Text1004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><FontSize Value='80'/>Just how long are they going to stay there...
  
  
  And this weather would make pretty good cover
  for them to attack too. <5 Type='0'/>Hm?<FontSize Value='100'/>
Text1014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>But everyone I've asked has lost their
  nerve the moment they looked over the
  edge and saw what they were up against.
Text1044: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>And I'd like to give you this too!
Text1034: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>They're supposedly a favorite of the horse
  god, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Malanya<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. He lives a short distance
  away from this stable, in fact.
  I'd planned to ask him to help with the
  monsters, and was going to give it to him
  as a gift...
  But now that the monsters have been
  handled, I'll give it to you instead!
  
  It's a really valuable carrot, and it doesn't
  grow around here. Be careful not to
  accidentally eat it!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Anyway, I should get back to work.
  Thanks for all your help!
