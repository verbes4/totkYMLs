  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Ah, how I'd love to put <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a panoramic
  picture of Floria Falls in that frame<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>A view from the bridge outside, with the
  towering waterfalls of Floria Falls all
  around you...
  That's the kind of stunning vista that can
  only be found in Faron.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Yes. If I'm to hang something here,
  a picture of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floria Falls<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a clear day<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  would be best.
  It would really draw in customers, don't
  you think?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But between the rainfall and all my work
  here, I don't know when I'll be able to
  paint something like that.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thanks to you, Link, a ray of light shines
  in my storm-battered stable.
  
  Visitors to Faron may not find clear skies
  outside, but in here, the mood will always
  be bright and sunny!

  Like...this one?
Com_Photo_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Huh? Did you bring me <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a picture of
  Floria Falls on a clear day<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?!
BurnedWakka_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you're that interested in ring garlands,
  why not go and get one yourself?
  
  They sell them at a place called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, up in Necluda!
9002: |
  Goodbye.
Com_Photo_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>It's bad form to have a picture frame
  hanging there, all sad and empty.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If only I had <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a picture of Floria Falls on a
  clear day<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I'd copy it as fast as I could and
  put it up there.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>That's a protective charm of sorts that
  has become rather popular lately.
  
  I hear it's based on the Ring Ruins that
  fell in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  You been to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>? It's up
  north in Necluda.
  
  Nice place. Definitely worth a visit.
9003: |
  I'm not showing you.
Com_Photo_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Do you happen to have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a picture of

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>Excuse me, but that flower decoration
  is for display only.
  
  If you want one, you'll have to make
  your way to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in Necluda
  up north.
  And while you're there, you can take a
  gander at the Ring Ruins. I hear they're a
  sight to behold!

  That said, if you ever want me to hang
  a different <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of Floria Falls on a
  clear day<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I'll be happy to oblige.
  Just show me the new picture. I'll paint
  up a copy and display it instead!
WakkaCharm: |
  Nice ring garland!
Com_Photo_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Ah, the falls really pack a punch.
  No matter how many times I see them,
  I'm always moved beyond words.
  That picture will make travelers glad they
  made the long, slippery trip to Faron!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>A picture of Floria Falls on a clear day...<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  If such a piece of art existed, it would be
  perfect for my stable.
9006: |
  I like this one better.
9007: |
  It's fine as is.
Com_Photo_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Whenever I look at that picture, I get
  excited all over again.

  receives orders from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  herself.
  At her direction, we opened a sanctuary
  for a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new animal species<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>right across
  the ravine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> from here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Ordinary visitors can't easily reach it,
  but with a telescope or the like, you
  might be able to snatch a glimpse.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Anyway, once again...
Talk_0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The rain is almost constant here, but once
  in a while, it does let up. Like now.
  
  When it's raining, the well behind the
  stable is too full for me to go inside.
  
  But when the skies are calm like this,
  the water in the well disappears and
  I can give it a good scrub.
  Come to think of it, I should probably go
  and do that now...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Take care not to slip!

Com_FirstTime_Only02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Now! You used <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lakeside Stable <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for the

  which means...
Com_Photo_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I spent a while mulling over what painting
  could be worthy of such a nice frame.
  Here's my thought.
  When it's clear out—<5 Type='0'/>which, granted, isn't
  often around these parts—<5 Type='0'/>you can get a
  beautiful view of Floria Falls.
  The best place to see it is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floria Bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  outside the stable. <5 Type='0'/>Wouldn't the view from
  there make a nice painting?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Problem is, I can't leave the stable
  unattended, and even if I could, it's rare
  that the weather is clear enough.
  But maybe there's some other way to
  get <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a panoramic view of Floria Falls on a
  clear day<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If someone brought me a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, for
  instance, then I'd be able to paint a
  copy and hang that up in the frame.
