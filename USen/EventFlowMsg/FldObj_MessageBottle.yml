  To you who have found my treasure,
  these ember trousers are but one piece
  of my grand collection.
  I have hidden an assortment of equipment
  across Hyrule. Notable pieces obtained in
  strange lands near and far.
  You've done well to find this one, and I
  will reward you with a hint to anotherâ€”
  the Fierce Deity Sword.
  Don the form of the Fierce Deity, and
  return to this place. There are three
  keys you will need.
  One beneath the bedchamber of Akkala's
  red-crowned citadel, one in the skull's left
  eye, one in an old stump in Hyrule Field.
  Good luck.

  To whoever finds this letter...
  
  
  <FontSize Value='125'/>You gotta help me out!<FontSize Value='100'/>
  
  
  I was out fishing when I got caught in
  a storm and had to run into a nearby
  cave to take shelter.
  Just when I was starting to dry off, this
  big rock came down and trapped me
  in here.
  I've managed to get some brightbloom
  seeds through a gap and into the water
  as a sort of marker.
  If I'm lucky, the seeds will blossom
  and the tide will take this letter and
  the flowers to shore.
  If you're reading this, it must've worked!
  So, whoever you are, I got a favor to ask.
  
  Could you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>follow the trail of brightblooms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  back to this cave and get me outta here?
  It'd be a real help!
