  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>I'm joking!<5 Type='0'/> It's just a joke!
  
  
  I know you already have your hands full
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>searching for Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, after all.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  But...really...once all this is over, I may
  just have a real reporter job available for
  you. Hopefully you'd like that!
Talk_246: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>All right, you two. Here's what you're
  going to do—<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>visit every stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for leads.
  Penn, you'll head this all up.
  Stables bring in people, and people bring
  details. And details are what we need.
  Now...<5 Type='1'/>get me some news!
Talk_Tribune14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>Let's see... Right around now, he should
  be canvassing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Canyon Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That's the last stable you'd find on the
  road before headin' into the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo
  Desert<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the southwest part of Hyrule.
  The weather down there swings between
  hot and cold, and horses can't go into
  the desert...
  There've been rumors the stable is going
  to shut down.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Penn said he needed to hurry and gather
  as much info as he could before anythin'
  like that happened...
  Then he was gone faster than you can
  say "goodbye." I know that for sure
  'cause all I heard from him was "goodb—"
Talk_263: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>I probably should have told him to take
  it easy and say somethin' to you, but...
  
  When I mentioned it to him, he said,
  "I've got to get to training and improve
  myself! It's the only way to stay ahead!"
Talk_281: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>You have got to be cold. You're making
  me cold just looking at you.
  
  Well, I'm not going to tell you how to
  dress for adventure, Link.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>I just appreciate you coming here.
Talk_247: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Readers all over Hyrule have their eyes
  and ears peeled for any information
  about Princess Zelda's whereabouts!
  The Lucky Clover Gazette is equally eager
  and is happy to help however it can!
Talk_Tribune_End01: |
  <FontSize Value='125'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Aha! Our trusty reporter!<FontSize Value='100'/><0 Type='4'/>So, Link...Penn's filled me in on all
  the latest.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>We're relieved that you managed to get
  to the bottom of every one of those
  rumors about Princess Zelda.
  And our paper's circulation is stronger
  than ever. I'm almost speechless!
Talk_282: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Interesting...<5 Type='1'/> You heard <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s
  voice while you were up in the sky, and
  now you're <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>searching for her<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Have you reported that to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Purah<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>? Head
  to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lookout Landing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> if you haven't. It's
  near the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins.
  I'm sure that she'd be relieved to see
  your face, Link.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, you're here at least. Good instincts,
  coming to the newspaper. We get leads
  about all sorts of things in Hyrule.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>We've heard about someone who looks
  like the princess appearing here and
  there too.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I was about to assign <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Penn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to chase
  those leads, but he could use a partner.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I won't tell Penn who you are. It's better
  if no one knows you're involved.
  
  What do you say? Think you could work
  with him as we investigate?
Talk_248: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>How's it going? Are you and Penn
  getting along OK?
Talk_265: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/>Did you lose track of your partner?
Talk_Tribune16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>Let's see... Right around now, he should
  be canvassing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Woodland Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That's a stable in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Eldin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> region off to
  the northeast. It's a good stop if you're
  on your way to Goron City.
  When a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Fairy<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> showed up there,
  that was all anyone talked about!
  
  At least for a while. There hasn't been
  any news lately...
  
  So of course Penn has headed that
  way. He said he could smell the scoop
  from here.
Talk_Tribune_End02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>In the end, we didn't actually uncover
  where Princess Zelda is.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>But now I know just who to call when
  we get another good lead.
  
  Until then, Link, you keep doing what
  you do—your part in all this will be clear
  soon enough, I bet.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>As for Penn, well, I've given him some
  time off with pay. Well-deserved too!
  He did a lot of reporting.
  I did tell him, "Hey, you say something
  nice to your partner after all this?"
  
  I think I put him on the spot, Link. He
  looked at me in an odd way and flew off
  with barely a "Soar long."
  He was right in the middle of writing a
  news article too.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>I can't say I know what that was about.
  He's bottling something up. Maybe.
Talk_266: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Of course, I wouldn't ask you to do this
  for free—though that'd be nice.
  
  Wait just a second. I'm going to get you
  a little incentive from the back.
Talk_Tribune_End03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Oh yeah, that'll look good on you.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  Oh, take this too.
Talk_249: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I'm sorry... I know worryin' after Penn
  is a small thing compared to all the other
  stuff going on.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>And of course we've heard news about
  the return of the Demon King.
  
  We even rushed an extra edition out just
  to share that news!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We at the newspaper might only be able
  to send out the news we hear...
  
  but we'll do all we can to help you find
  Princess Zelda!
  
  And don't forget, Link—if you're ever
  feeling lost, reading the newspaper might
  just help you!

  You work with Penn to chase down all

  Work with Penn to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get to the bottom of

  you froggy armor, piece by piece.
Talk_Tribune_End05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>What do you think? Pretty good, huh?
  That will really help you stick to wet
  surfaces without slipping.
Talk_Tribune_End06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>That's what I thought you wanted, but

  Wasse's...Wahahasa's... <5 Type='1'/>That bluff that
  Penn mentioned.
  He was pretty smug about how the place
  could only be reached by those with
  wings too...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, he owes you for all the research you
  did as his partner. It let him write about
  Princess Zelda, after all.
  He'd told me he needed to become
  someone his own partner can rely on...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I think I'm lookin' forward to the next
  time I see Penn!
