Talk_31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That was very helpful. I'll buy ore from
  you anytime.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Though keep in mind that I'm often
  looking for different ore at
  different times.
  So check in with me every so often to see
  what I'm looking for.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>You know, it seems most everyone's into
  that marbled rock roast and not much
  else. Not a great time to procure ore.

  ore at any old shop.
  
  Amber is getting easier to come by, so the
  selling price is lower than ever.
  
  I'm the only one who will buy them at a
  high price these days.
