  I am the Sage of Lightning! Witness this new power
  I possess!
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_038_c: |
  It seems I can finally repay you.
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_034_b: |
  And hereâ€”as proof of my vow!
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_026_b: |
  I will gladly strike down this so-called Demon King!
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_032_b: |
  Link, give me your hand.
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_024_c: |
  My destiny as a sage, my duties as chief, and fighting
  side-by-side with you?
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_022_c: |
  So it's my destiny to fight by your side...
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_039_c: |
  OK, should we head back to town?
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_037_c: |
  Use that ring to call upon my power whenever you
  need it.
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_027_b: |
  I guess it's time to claim my destiny!
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_033_b: |
  I, Riju, the Sage of Lightning, swear that I will stand
  with you!
DmT_GE_Awake_Text_025_b: |
  Ha! Sounds like fun!
