  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The princess was quite fond of our little
  village. She often came here, disguising
  herself as a simple traveler.
  It was during one of those visits that she
  painted the picture of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lover's Pond<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>You know, Kiana's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>restaurant<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and
  Chessica's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>salt spa<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> were both inspired
  by Princess Zelda's ideas.
  Really, we have her to thank for our
  reputation as Hyrule's top vacation spot.
