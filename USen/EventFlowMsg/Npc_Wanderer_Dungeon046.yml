  It's in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a canyon in Hebra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. We can only
  hope it is not too dangerous there.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So... Have you learned of any new

  as well. Please continue to search
  for geoglyphs.

  for them, although it's hardly quick work.
  
  Maybe we could survey more territory by

  but no, that's not safe.

  find as one might expect.
