  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh! Are you back to make more ice?
  The desert has really heated up today,
  hasn't it?
talk0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh! Are you back to make more ice? You
  can't get enough of the cold, can you?
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you are back to make more ice, I'd like
  it if you could do the same as last time...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>This is looking pretty good, I say!<5 Type='0'/>
  I think this can make it to town
  without melting!
  This bundle of ice is for me, isn't it?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Are you back to make more ice?
talk0004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Sarq!<5 Type='0'/> And this is for you! Enjoy!
talk0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>In that case, I'd like it if you could do the
  same as last time...
talk0005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Feel free to come back and make more
  ice, OK? 
  
  Er, but I don't have anything I can give
  you as a reward right now...
  
  It wouldn't feel right to accept your help
  when I can't repay you, so give me some
  time, OK?
  You could always visit the spa in Gerudo
  Town in the mean—
  
  Oh, wait.<5 Type='1'/> You're a voe, so you aren't
  allowed inside Gerudo Town. <5 Type='1'/>Maybe you
  could relax at Kara Kara Bazaar instead?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Wait, really? <5 Type='0'/>I'm sorry, for some reason
  I just assumed you'd put that together to
  give me.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, that's a shame, but OK.
  
  
  If you put together some ice slabs and
  want to give them to me, just let me
  know, OK?
talk0012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Are you after the ice that our townspeople
  value so highly? You lousy thief...
  
  I'd take you on right here and now, but
  I don't want to dirty this place with the
  chaos of a fight.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Get out of here before I change my mind!
talk0007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Did you come to make more ice slabs for
  me? I appreciate the thought, but I don't
  really need ice right now.
  And besides, I don't have anything I can
  give you as a reward at the moment...
  
  It wouldn't feel right to accept your help
  when I can't repay you, so give me some
  time, OK?

  It's all yours!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I'm sorry to keep asking for your help over
  and over again, but we're still suffering
  from a shortage of ice...
