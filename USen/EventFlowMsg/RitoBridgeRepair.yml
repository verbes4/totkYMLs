Talk_0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>There's some wood stockpiled at the
  newspaper office, but not enough to
  rebuild the bridge.
  I guess our only option is to chop down
  some of the trees around here... Urgh...
Near_0002: |
  It's worse than I thought...
Talk_0041: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, Link. It's about the bridge job.

  nothing for him to work with.

  We must rebuild the bridge.

  We're short on wood...
Talk_0015: |

  about, so I guess it makes sense...
Talk_0016: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Yep. We may be able to get what we
  need by chopping down trees.
