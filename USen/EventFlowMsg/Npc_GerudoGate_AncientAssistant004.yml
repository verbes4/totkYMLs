  but she's off visiting Gerudo Town.
  
  Now that I think about it, she should have
  returned already...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Gerudo Canyon is a huge canyon to the
  south. It leads to Gerudo Desert, where
  you would find Gerudo Town.
Talk_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>However, lately the days in Gerudo
  Canyon have been blisteringly hot and the
  nights have been absolutely freezing.
  You'll collapse before long if you aren't
  prepared to deal with extreme weather.
  
  For example, I've been maintaining a
  careful diet to help me deal with these
  extreme temperatures.
Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you want to know more, chat with the
  girl in that tent over there.
  
  She should be able to answer any
  questions you have.
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Rubble and ruins have been falling all over
  since the Upheaval, but the ruins at the
  border are particularly immense.
  We've set up this camp so we can carry
  out a full investigation of that site.
  
  This area has a very harsh environment,
  but we make interesting discoveries
  every day, so it's worth it!
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You should keep an eye out for other
  investigators or travelers.
  
  If you're going to pass through
  Gerudo Canyon, you may find others
  with useful information to share!
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you like the unique ruins up ahead,
  you might also be interested in visiting
  Kakariko Village off to the east.
  The various ruins there are fascinating,
  and definitely worth your time.
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Was there anything else?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Mmm.<5 Type='1'/> What are you doing out this late?
Talk_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Give me a chance to get where I am
  going, all right?
0000: |
  Giant ruins?
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, it's the young fellow from before.
  
  
  If you have some time, you should go take
  a look at the giant ruins on the border of
  Gerudo Canyon. They are quite a sight!
0001: |
  Gerudo Canyon?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Good morning.
Talk_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oho...<5 Type='1'/> Might you be a traveler?
  
  
  I'm camping here so I can investigate
  the giant ruins that fell at the entrance to
  Gerudo Canyon, just up ahead.
0002: |
  Goodbye.
Fukidashi_01: |
  Fascinating...
