  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>decorating<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> a weapon in a stylish way...
  
  She told me to "make it <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sparkle<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!" And
  that "it must radiate burning <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>passion<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!"
  But I don't know what she's talking about.
  She's got an allergy to monsters too, so
  that means <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster parts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are off-limits.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>My mentor said the decoration should

  but I don't know what to do.

  that means <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster parts <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>are off-limits.
