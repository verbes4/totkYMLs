  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's essential that you're prepared to
  encounter a monster at any time.<0 Type='4'/>You can do that by staying well-rested,
  staying <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stocked-up on food<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and making
  sure your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>weapons are combat-ready<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  These little preparations can make all the
  difference when you're in harm's way.
Near_BackRange_01: |
  You can't be too careful.
StartPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Fighting isn't just about physical strength
  and skill. It's also about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>knowing more<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  than your opponent.
  That's why I read the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>newspaper<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You
  never know what you might need to
  know someday.
GoalPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I heard there's a big picture drawn on the
  ground up <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>geoglyph<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—<5 Type='0'/>that's what
  they call it.
  But you know what else they've got up
  in those snowfields? No roads and no
  places to hide!
  Plus, I hear there's a huge <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>with
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>three heads<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>... <5 Type='1'/>Yeesh!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'll go someday, but I think I better bulk
  up a little first.
Near_BackRange_02: |
  Watch for snowballs.
GoRange_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh yeah, I've got some info to share!<0 Type='4'/>Have you seen those monsters with one
  large eye? They'll <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chase after any enemy
  they catch sight of<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  If only we could use their <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>eyeballs as
  weapons<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Seems like the other eyeballs
  I plucked from enemies are good for that.
GoRange_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You know, some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monsters <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>just set up a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>large base <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>nearby.<0 Type='4'/>Ever since I heard about that, I've been
  dreaming about going in there and taking
  'em all out!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>But if I tried that today, I think I'd be
  dead before I reached the entrance.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So, I gotta train up and learn combat
  strategies, like how to assess enemies'
  moves and time my attacks!
  When I'm done with all that, I'll be those
  monsters' worst nightmare!
Near_GoalPoint_01: |
  I want to see a geoglyph!
Near_StartPoint_01: |
  Learn all you can.
Near_RestPoint_01: |
  Make sure to rest.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Since then, I've been traveling all over,
  trying to get strong enough to decide my

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Maybe running into each other is a sign
  I'm doing things right!<5 Type='0'/> I'm going to be just

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Oh...<5 Type='0'/> You're the guy from that time with

  I'm here in Hebra to get stronger.
  Training in cold weather is the best way

  skill, yes, but also <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>knowledge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. That's why
  I read the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>newspaper <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>every day.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>You never know. <5 Type='0'/>A trivial-seeming scrap

GoRange_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>They say that monsters with one large eye
  will <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chase down any enemy they catch in

  One day, I'll be strong enough to try <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>using
  one of those big eyes as a weapon<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
GoRange_02_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Good fighting's all about strategy. You

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>At least, that's what I've heard...
  I'm not even strong enough to take
  a Bokoblin.
  Let alone all the monsters in that
  stronghold near here...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But! No point getting down in the dumps
  about it. I've got training to do!
GoalPoint_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I heard there's a big picture drawn on the

  with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>three heads<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  So I'm conflicted. If that thing found me,
  I'm not sure how long I'd last.
RestPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I consider rest to be a key part of combat.
  I mean it!<0 Type='4'/>It's a chance to think about the battle
  ahead. How strong are your enemies?
  What terrain will you be fighting on?
  Most importantly, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>what food will you bring<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>how will you prepare your weapons<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?<0 Type='4'/>If you don't rest, you'll never get to ask
  yourself these essential questions!
BackRange_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Be careful exploring the caves around
  here. Sometimes they have monsters
  camped out inside.
  I learned that the hard way. Once I
  walked into a cave, only to be greeted
  by a full-blown Bokoblin ambush.<0 Type='4'/>Not recommended!
BackRange_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Be careful. There's a cave nearby that's
  absolutely packed with monsters.
BackRange_02_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>A stationary snowball, that's one thing.
  But a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>snowball <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>with momentum? Deadly!
  
  If you're not careful, a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>flying monster<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  might <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rain one down <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>on you before you
  can dodge out of the way.
  So be vigilant, OK? Eyes up!
BackRange_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Watch out for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>snowballs <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>out here. Deadly!
  I'm not kidding!
  
  You get hit by one rolling down a hill?
  Lights out!
  
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>flying overhead <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pelts you
  with one<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>? Sweet dreams, sword boy!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Or, in the fleeting chance you survive...<5 Type='0'/>
  you'll be too embarrassed to tell anyone
  what happened.
