  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lover's Pond<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> was a fabled place when I

  I'm impressed at how well it seems to

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Heh, it's inspiring. Makes me feel like
  I've still got a little fight left in me too.

  Why not go now? Well, young one,
  let me tell you about bad backs and
  what mountain climbing does to them...
  No, I'll spare you. But believe me when I

  We never got any rain back in Gerudo

  So when I first encountered rain,
  I enjoyed it a lot. But now... Now it's
  just a pain I could do without.
