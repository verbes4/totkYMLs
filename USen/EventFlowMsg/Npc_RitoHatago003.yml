  Are you really that interested in my orb?
  
  
  I hear there's someone in Gerudo Town
  who's investigating all these ancient
  whatchamacallits.
  So once I get into town, I'm planning on
  finding somebody who knows their stuff
  about this stuff!

  My guy! It's all thanks to you that we can
  all sit around laughing like this!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The only reason I joined the caravan
  squad was to get that orb appraised
  in Gerudo Town.
  But the orb's gone, and the soldiers don't
  trust us anymore, so there's no more
  reason for me to be part of the squad.
  That's what I thought, until I fell into that
  sinkhole and saw how worried everyone
  was about me...<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It feels pretty great to have friends!

  Get a load of this orb! Seems really old
  and REALLY expensive, don't you think?

  Well, that one's mine! If you want your
  own, you're gonna have to find it yourself.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Isn't this orb great?! I bet it's every bit
  as expensive as it is old!

  Thank you, my guy! We wouldn't be
  hanging around laughing like this if you
  hadn't come to save the day!
  That orb over there is all yours now.
  Sit on it, roll it around, do whatever you
  want with it!

  is investigating all this neat old stuff.
  
  That's actually why I joined the caravan
  squadâ€”to get into the town and learn
  about that orb.
  There's not much reason for me to be part
  of it anymore, but...I did appreciate that
  everyone was so worried about me.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003000'/>Kinda reminds ya just how nice it is to

  Honestly, getting into that town is why I
  joined the caravan squad to begin with.
  
  There's not much reason for me to be part

  worried about me.
