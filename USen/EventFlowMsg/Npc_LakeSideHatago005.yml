  they're vicious beasts who used to live
  in Taran Pass.
  But recently, for some reason, all three
  of them came here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Most of the time they're asleep, but so
  much as get near them and they'll wake
  up and go berserk.
  With them around, nobody can go inside

  Those three caves are mining hot spots
  made by the Upheaval.
  
  They drew a lot of travelers here,
  to Lakeside Stable.
  
  But with the three giant monster brothers
  holing up inside, nobody comes to the
