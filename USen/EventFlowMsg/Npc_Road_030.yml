  all I seem to retain.

Common_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>I thought I at least had the basics downâ€”
  splashing yourself with water to cool
  down, stuff like that.

  I felt so clueless.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>But clearly, I'm not prepared enough.

  when there's no water?! It boggles and
  bends the mind!
