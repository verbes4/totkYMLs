  Tulin... My brave fledgling...
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_006_c: |
  That monster you defeated, the source of that intense
  blizzard... It was summoned by the Demon King.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_007_b: |
  He thought it could stop you from obtaining the stone
  you just foundâ€”my secret stone.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_001_b: |
  I know that voice...
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_008_b: |
  Demon King? Secret stone?
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_002_b: |
  It's you... You're the one who's been guiding us?
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_009_b: |
  This is a lot to learn all of a sudden, I know.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_003_c: |
  Yes. I am your ancestor from a time long ago.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_004_b: |
  I proudly served Hyrule's first king. I was a Rito
  warrior and a sage with control of the wind.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_010_b: |
  But listen while I tell you what happened in the past.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_005_b: |
  Where you fight, the winds follow... I would
  expect nothing less from my descendant.
  You make me proud.
DmT_RT_StoneMind_Text_012_b: |
  A tale of the Imprisoning War and the mission our
  people must accomplish!
