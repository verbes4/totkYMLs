  my great-great-great-great-grandpa...<5 Type='0'/>
  Probably even more greats than that!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>It says the shrine is sacred, so there must
  be some truly amazing treasure there!

  Finley swam inside of it all alone?
  
  And now Sasan is trying to go in after her
  on a raft?!

  turn out like that.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Poor Sasan is probably desperate to catch
  up to Finley so they can find the treasure
  together. I hope he makes it inside safely.

  I wish the sludge would go away and that
  things would return to normal.

  Before he knew what hit him, she had
  grabbed <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sasan <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and together they raced

  She'll be fine, but I'm a little worried
  about poor Sasan.
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tarm Point<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is way off to the southeast of
  the domain, so it's pretty far...<5 Type='1'/> I hope they
  make it there safely.

  but to think that Finley rushed into the
  cave all by herself...
  Poor Sasan is probably desperate to find
  Finley so they can look for the treasure.
  I hope he can manage a raft to catch up.

  No one is taking walks because of the
