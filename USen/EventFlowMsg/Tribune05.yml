  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I've tried to make these garden beds as
  perfect as they were before.
  
  It's just so hard on my own. If only
  someone would help...
talk0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sure. Glad to help. Keep the tools a little
  longer. And here's a tip...
  
  Don't overwork the soil.
talk0068: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hey! That raft belongs to the stable.
  Don't go cutting the rope without my
  permission.
talk0021: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You said you'll help! I accept your offer!
0001: |
  You saw the princess?
talk0069: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hey, hold on there! You've gotta wait for
  me to get aboard before you cut the rope.
talk0070: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>...Phew.<5 Type='0'/> All right. Ready.
talk0022: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What?! I didn't say that!
0002: |
  Goodbye.
talk0023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Well, close enough! So what if you don't
  say what you really think. I won't hold
  that against you!
  Now, how about you go work that soil
  like you said. I'll go tend to the flowers.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>We'll have this whole garden back in
  beautiful shape by the time the princess
  returns. It'll be the pride of Hyrule.
  Oh! And here's a tip from me...<5 Type='2'/> Put your
  back into it!
talk0072: |
  Don't forget to cut the rope when you're
  ready to launch!
talk0024: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'm off to report back to Traysi. See you
  around, partner.
talk0073: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Fella? I don't think this is the way to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floret Sandbar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
0005: |
  I can take you!
talk0026: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>All this was about a sanctuary for plants
  and flowers, huh?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Sounds just like our princess to find time
  to work on a garden alongside folks while
  restoring Hyrule.
talk0074: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>That's our stable's raft! Please stop doing
  whatever that is you're doing to it.
talk0075: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You take it from here! Just cut the rope
  when you're ready to launch.
0006: |
  Good luck...
talk0028: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That was a long time ago, but I do
  remember she said she needed them for
  something at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floret Sandbar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  It's around the river bend and then a
  good distance after that.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I'd take the raft there myself, but after all
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>that stuff fell from the sky<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I'm having a
  hard time getting down the river.
  So you might say I'm in a bind.
talk0076: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You can go. I'll stay here. What else
  have I got to do, right?
0007: |
  Floret Sandbar?
talk0029: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You did a great job getting us here!
  Where'd you learn how to handle a raft
  like that?
  I thought it'd be a rough run, but it all
  turned out fine.
talk0030: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>HEY!<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  What do you think you're doing, just
  barging in here? This place is for flowers
  and plants—all of them, precious!
  You'd better watch out. You'll rue the
  day you trample on any of them!

  I promise we won't pick any flowers.

talk0045: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey, partner. Get a good night's sleep?<5 Type='1'/>
  Oh, <5 Type='0'/>actually, hold that thought.<5 Type='1'/> We don't
  have time to squawk right now.
talk0046: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey, partner. How you doing?<5 Type='1'/> Actually,<5 Type='0'/>
  let's just get to it.<5 Type='0'/> You're always on an
  even keel.
talk0000: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I got a very interesting lead about our
  missing princess. We could have a pretty
  huge story here.
  Sounds as if one night a while back—and
  I'm not sure how far—<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  borrowed this stable's farm tools.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>That's a bit unusual. Why would our
  princess...<5 Type='0'/>need farm tools?<5 Type='1'/> But this story
  has another odd twist.
  She promised to return them...<5 Type='0'/>and didn't.<5 Type='1'/>
  Now, this all might seem trivial. She's a
  busy princess, after all.
  Still, these are strange times. So I got to
  thinking—only <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>weapons decayed <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>during
  the Upheaval.
  Maybe the princess was in desperate
  need of tools for...<5 Type='1'/> Wait, Penn...<5 Type='0'/> Hold on.
  You've gotten ahead of yourself.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>We need to gather the facts—when, what,
  where, who!
  
  Let's start at the beginning. I heard that
  a man named <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Izra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> lent her the tools.
  
  He's right around here—watches over
  the stable's raft, I heard. Let's get to
  work, partner.
talk0047: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What's wrong? Did you forget where
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floret Sandbar <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is?
talk0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>What did <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>need those
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farm tools <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for?
  
  I have a wild guess that it's because only
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>weapons decayed <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>during the Upheaval,
  and that would mean...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>No, we need facts! I heard that a man
  named <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Izra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> spoke to the princess. I think
  he watches over the raft at this stable.
talk0048: |
  I mean, really... Why?
talk0050: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey, partner. You have a good day?<5 Type='1'/>
  Oh, <5 Type='0'/>actually, hold that thought.<5 Type='1'/> We can
  squawk all about it later.
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Sorry, I'm a little busy right now...
talk0049: |
  I need those farm tools...
talk0051: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This rain, huh, partner? Will it ever end?
  Oh, <5 Type='0'/>no need to answer that.<5 Type='1'/> I know it'll
  end at some point. Just making small talk.
talk0003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Urgh.<5 Type='1'/> How can I get any work done right
  unless I get the stable's tools back?
talk0052: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm ready whenever you—
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>Um, hold on. <5 Type='0'/>I can't sit down in the chair.
talk0005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh*<5 Type='1'/> I know we could clear up this mess
  if someone could take me downriver to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floret Sandbar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on the raft.

  would show up. You work with Penn from
  the newspaper, right?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I didn't want this to get out, because I
  don't want people to think I'm saying bad
  things about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But she borrowed our stable's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farm tools<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  and hasn't given them back.
talk0055: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Whew... Finally caught up with you two!
  
  
  I was flying around this whole area,
  partner, trying to find our facts, when I
  saw you on this raft.
  I figured you'd chased down our story,
  so I flew right on down to help. But, uh...<5 Type='0'/>
  where are we?
talk0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What?!<5 Type='0'/> You mean that, fella? You'll take
  me to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Floret Sandbar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thanks!<5 Type='0'/> Can't tell you how much I
  appreciate you offering to do that.
talk0056: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Whoa! Who's this?<5 Type='0'/> Ever met her
  before, partner?
Near_Ready_1001: |
  Could be a huge story...
talk0057: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, really?<5 Type='0'/> Let's get off the raft and
  start from scratch, then.
talk0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You take it from here!
talk0058: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, seems like we got those facts we
  wanted,<5 Type='0'/> and those two...<5 Type='0'/>worked it all
  out, I guess?
  I can't wait to write this up. Our readers
  love glimpses into the princess's life. Here
  she was, helping to create a garden.
  Expect the story in an issue of the paper
  soon. It'll be a real headline!
talk0059: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What the—<5 Type='0'/> Where's my raft?<5 Type='0'/> I better put
  it back where it was to start.
talk0060: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There we go...<5 Type='0'/> Whew!<5 Type='0'/> Close one!
talk0012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh* <5 Type='1'/>I wonder why Princess Zelda won't
  give the stable's tools back.

  Look, it seems like we're lost. How about
  we go back to the dock and start over?
talk0016: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>That's right—some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farm tools <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>from our

talk0064: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Tell me when you're ready to go. Don't

talk0017: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, well. That's my fault. I have them.
  
  
  This area is home to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s
  plant sanctuary. She asked me to take
  care of this special place with her.
  She loved these plants, and spent a lot of
  time here, making sure the garden beds
  were happy homes for them.
  We meant to return the tools after we
  finished our work here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But the princess—well,<5 Type='0'/> they say she
  went <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>missing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And all our hard work was ruined when...<5 Type='0'/>
  oh, these darn ruins crashed down!
