  This mural must be the great war recorded in the
  royal histories!
Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_e: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_007_b: |
  They must have forged a relationship with the
  Hylians of that time, working together to establish...
Dm_OP_0020_Text_002_b: |
  include stories of a great war fought long ago. It was
  a conflict between allied tribes and someone only ever
  referred to as the Demon King.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_007_c: |
  the kingdom of Hyrule!
Dm_OP_0020_Text_015_b: |
  All right, then. Now to use this invention of Purah's.
  I'm glad I didn't leave it behind.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_010_b: |
  And then this... It shows the Demon King!
Dm_OP_0020_Text_010_c: |
  And a fierce battle against him.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_ab: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_010_d: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_005_b: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_018_b: |
  Just what is this place?
Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_b: |
  Look at these murals...
Dm_OP_0020_Text_005_c: |
  It is said that my ancestors—the first of Hyrule's royal
  family...
Dm_OP_0020_Text_013_b: |
  This is the Imprisoning War and the events that
  led up to it!
Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_c: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_005_d: |
  were born from a union with gods who had descended
  from the heavens.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_d: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_008_b: |
  This figure... He seems to be stealing something of
  incredible power from the young kingdom.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_003_b: |
  Is it possible? Do these murals depict the
  same legend?
Dm_OP_0020_Text_016_b: |
  It's so easy to record. You point it and click.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_003_c: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_011_b: |
  If the creature depicted here really does represent the
  Demon King, then... 
Dm_OP_0020_Text_003_d: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_006_b: |
  These murals tell a similar story, and if they are
  accurate, then the gods mentioned were the Zonai...
Dm_OP_0020_Text_019_b: |
  Maybe we'll find more answers farther ahead.
  Link, let's keep moving deeper.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_001_b: |
  The written histories of the royal family...
Dm_OP_0020_Text_014_b: |
  Link! This is a huge discovery!
Dm_OP_0020_Text_014_c: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_009_b: |
  This all aligns with what I've read during my studies.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_004_b: |
  This is similar to the statues we saw earlier—a Zonai.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_009_c: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_b: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_000_aab: |
  You're not hurt are you, Link?
Dm_OP_0020_Text_004_c: |
  And these figures look like Hylians.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_012_b: |
  
Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_c: |
  Oh, it looks like the rest of the murals are obscured...
Dm_OP_0020_Text_004_d: |
  This depiction certainly suggests that the Zonai
  descended from the heavens.
Dm_OP_0020_Text_012_c: |
  Incredible!
Dm_OP_0020_Text_017_d: |
