  It's hectic with the investigation into the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fallen ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and there are available beds,
  so it's a good time to get some rest in.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Well, he wouldn't do anything risky,
  so I'm not too worried about him.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Still, he's sure taking his time coming
  back, so I guess I am a little worried...
0032: |
  Fallen ruins?

  mean somewhere dangerous like the
  chasm near there or anything.
  Specifically, he went to Hyrule Castle's
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>dining hall<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Some folks investigating the chasms told
  him about some super-special <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>recipe<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in
  the dining hall, so he left—just like that.

  grab another empty bed.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Nappin's sleep talking is particularly
  audible here, so you probably want a
  bed a little farther from him.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>His physical condition has been
  deteriorating ever since he investigated
  one of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chasms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  That's despite how long he's been back,
  which has been quite a while. He still
  hasn't made much of a recovery.

  Burmano—the guy in charge of cooking—
  went to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule Castle<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and NEVER

  across the land known as chasms.
  
  In fact, there's one nearby just beneath
  Hyrule Castle and another to the south
  of Lookout Landing.
  But if you go plumbing those Depths,
  you'll come across plenty of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gloom<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  
  You touch that stuff, and your health will

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Anyway, there's a young girl named Josha
  who's been heading up investigations into
  the chasms.
  Despite her age, she's been leading the
  charge—pretty remarkable, if you ask me.

  Purah's made it the standard policy that

  She says it's what Zelda would want.

  use the empty one over there.
  
  It's far enough from Nappin, in theory, so
  you won't be constantly annoyed by his
  sleep talking.
  He zonked out after an investigation into
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chasms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But he's the kind of person who loses
  track of time when he gets engrossed in
  things, so I do wonder when he'll be back.

  Please, feel free to anytime.
  
  Burmano was on duty here, but he went

  So it's my job to watch the fire here in

  A big Zonai ruin fell into Lookout
