  <3 Type='0' Data='0901'/>Don't scare me like that! My poor heart

  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Eh?<5 Type='1'/> Are you by chance looking for

  at the cave.
Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Caves are really dangerous. Is finding

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>You're...<5 Type='1'/>the one who was searching
  for the same Bubbulfrog I was, if I'm
  not mistaken.
Talk_16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Supposedly, there are creatures called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbulfrogs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that live in caves.
  
  They're bluish and whitish and stick to
  walls. Odd stuff.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And those two folks at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Woodland Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  in northeast Eldin—curious pair, very
  strange, maybe a little off...
  They're looking for something the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbulfrogs drop<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<5 Type='0'/> They asked me to
  do the collecting.
Talk_29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Hello there.<5 Type='0'/> Pleasant evening
  we're having.
Talk_17: |
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>So.<5 Type='1'/> Did they ask you too?
Talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>They offered treasure in exchange.
  Good treasure! It was a sweet deal.<5 Type='0'/>
  At least, it would have been...
  But I don't know the first thing about
  cave creatures.<0 Type='4'/>That treasure was awful appealing
  though...
Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Eh? Ah, you again.
  
  
  Caves are dangerous, you know. Is finding
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbul gems<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> even worth it?
NakedPlayer: |
  N...naked?
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Oh.<5 Type='0'/> What a shame, what a shame...
Talk_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I'm done looking for Bubbul gems.
  Done. Done!
  
  And you should be done too, or you'll
  end up a funny color, just like the guy at
  Woodland Stable!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>That said, it's a shame about that
  treasure... <5 Type='0'/>I'd never even heard of a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mystic robe<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<5 Type='1'/> Maybe...
  No!<5 Type='0'/> I'm definitely done!<5 Type='0'/> Definitely...
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But that treasure... Ooh, it's hard to give
  up a trade like that...
Near_00: |
  Hmmm...
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I'm just going to cross my fingers and
  wish real hard that I'll get the treasure
  without any effort whatsoever.
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's in the name. Some kind of weird thing
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbulfrogs <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>drop in caves.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>All I know is that it glows a bluish white,
  just like the Bubbulfrog.
  
  Eh?<5 Type='0'/> Wait a second...
  
  
  That strange pair over at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Woodland Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  in Eldin to the northeast—the ones who
  asked me to find <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbul gems<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  One of them was bluish white. Odd color.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>You don't think he got cursed by a
  Bubbulfrog, do you?!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Ooh, this is really dangerous. When things
  sound too good, there's always a catch...
0000: |
  That's right.
0001: |
  Nope.
0003: |
  I'll leave you to it.
0004: |
  What is it again?
Talk_30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>After we met, curiosity got the better of
  me and I decided to go looking for a
  Bubbulfrog in a cave.
  But that was...not a great idea. <5 Type='0'/>Caves are
  dark, and there's no way to know what's
  lurking around in there.
  Plus, that strange duo... They just up and
  disappeared from Woodland Stable!
0005: |
  What's a Bubbulfrog?
Talk_31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Ah,<5 Type='0'/> I ran into you recently, didn't I?
Talk_32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004c00'/>What?!<5 Type='1'/> You got your hands on a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbul gem<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?!
  
  You had the courage to not only go in a
  cave but to face down a strange creature?
  You're a brave one, that's for sure.
Talk_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Aha! I knew it! They must have asked
  you too.
0007: |
  Goodbye.
Talk_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>After that, I didn't really know what to do
  with myself...so I did some wandering and
  some thinking too, and ended up here.
  And you know, I've decided that I'm a
  careful man, and I'll take comfort and
  safety over rewards and riches any day.
Talk_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Hi there.<5 Type='1'/> You look like someone on
  a real journey.
Talk_34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ugh, this is some awful weather
  we're having.
Talk_22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>If you've made your way to a stable in
  this kind of downpour, you must be
  quite the traveler.
Talk_35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The thing is,<5 Type='0'/> stables are very pleasant
  places to be—comfortable, safe.
  
  Bubbulfrog hunting in a dark cave...<5 Type='0'/>no,
  thanks. A cautious guy like me is better
  suited to relaxing in a place like this. 
Talk_36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Turns out <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbulfrogs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> can be found
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>in every cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. So I'm thinking I'll maybe
  check out another cave.
  Though, I doubt I'll be able to find one
  that isn't dark and scary.
Talk_23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Good evening.<5 Type='1'/> You look like someone on
  quite a journey.
Talk_37: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you managed to get your hands on
  a Bubbul gem...<0 Type='4'/>you should try to find those two
  oddballs at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Woodland Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in
  Eldin to the northeast.
  Those fellas were in a real frenzy to find
  those gems. I bet you'll find them in the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave near the stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='1c005100750065007300740069006f006e004e006f0072006d0061006c00'/>I heard them talking about some rare
  treasure they had. I think it was a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mystic robe<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...<5 Type='0'/>or something like that.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Yeah, might not be a bad idea to go
  see them.
Talk_24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So, strange story... I ran into these two
  folks—curious pair, odd even—at
  Woodland Stable up north in Eldin...
  And they asked me to search for this
  creature called a Bubbulfrog that's
  supposed to be found in caves.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But the thing about caves is...<5 Type='0'/>they're
  dark, and you don't know what's hiding
  in them.
  Plus, the pair in question just up and
  disappeared from the stable.
Talk_25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Still though...<5 Type='1'/> I do wonder where that
  strange duo looking for the Bubbulfrogs
  disappeared to.
  With that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>motley-looking cart<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> they
  were pulling, you'd think they'd be
  easy to spot anywhere...
Talk_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>These <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bubbulfrog <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>creatures are supposed
  to live in caves, eh?
Talk_26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Hello there.
