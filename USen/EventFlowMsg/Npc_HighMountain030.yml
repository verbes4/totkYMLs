  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>No time for small talk. I need to go join
  Gesane in the food-gathering effort.<0 Type='4'/>If you really need to talk to me, find me
  later and we can chat then.
Talk32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Shouldn't be much longer before the
  food shortage is resolved. <5 Type='1'/>I think we're
  going to make it just fine.
Near02: |
  I'd better get going...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000540069007200650064005f0030003100'/>So ends another busy day.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>My little sister, Bedoli, is swamped every
  day with managing our supplies. We
  barely ever get to see each other.<0 Type='4'/>Hopefully our jobs should calm down soon
  now that the blizzard has stopped.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>The blizzard stopping has been a big load
  off my mind.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>That said, we're still short on supplies,
  and I still spend a lot of time every day
  gathering food.
Near03: |
  This is a good haul.

  They're scavenging for food.<0 Type='4'/>No, I'm not going to show you the way.
  I need to keep an eye on what we've
  amassed so far.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003000'/>Be on your guard. There's a creature in
  that cave that hops around on the walls.<0 Type='4'/>It probably won't bother you if you stay
  away from it. Good luck finding Tulin.

  have to do it under the pressure that the
  blizzard forced on us.<0 Type='4'/>Anyway. Time for another day's
  honest work!
Talk29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Now where did I see it?
Near04: |
  Almost home...
Near06: |
  Not a bad harvest.

  these mountains anytime soon, what with
  the blizzard and all.<0 Type='4'/>I'M here because it's a good place to find
  food for my people. Why are YOU here?
Near07: |
  So that's where it was.

  supplies, so I'll wait until she's free
  to invite her to go check it out.<0 Type='4'/>The more bodies we bring, the more food
  we can haul back to the village.
Near08: |
  Back to work I go!
Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What? You found the cave?!<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Huh! <5 Type='1'/>So the "bird" I saw was some snow
  that overlapped with the perch's shadow.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>What a relief! <5 Type='0'/>I feel so much better now
  that I know what was going on there.<0 Type='4'/>Thanks! <5 Type='0'/>I'm going to find Bedoli so we
  can check out the cave together!
Talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're looking for Tulin, he and Gesane
  went deep into the cave to scavenge
  for food.
  It's a long way to where they are though,
  and I can't exactly go with you.<0 Type='4'/>The moment I take my eyes off our stuff,
  I just know some monster's going to come
  along and snatch it.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're going in to find Tulin, watch out
  for the creature that hops around on the
  walls in there.<0 Type='4'/>I don't think it'll hurt you if you stay away
  from it, but you never know.
Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I just lugged the food we scavenged from
  the cave back to the village.<0 Type='4'/>It was a pretty good harvest, but not so
  good that we can breathe easy.<0 Type='4'/>Once I'm rested, it's back to the food
  hunt for me.
0001: |
  I found it.
Talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What possessed a Hylian to come out
  here? Don't act like you don't feel the
  weather. I can see you shivering inside.<0 Type='4'/>This isn't a good time to talk anyway.
  I was about to join Gesane in the effort
  to scavenge for food.<0 Type='4'/>The longer this blizzard goes, the harder
  it gets just to keep ourselves fed.
Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The food we scrounged is safe and sound
  in the village now, but our work isn't over.<0 Type='4'/>Once I've had a rest, I'll be right back
  at it.
