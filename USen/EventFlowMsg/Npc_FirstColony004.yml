  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I thought I'd go to Kakariko Village for
  fortified pumpkins and swift carrots, so of
  course it started raining. Just my luck.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I still need to repay you for what you did
  back at Kakariko Village.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>I hope that innkeeper's doing all right.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>He falls asleep every single time you take
  your eyes off him. It doesn't inspire much
  confidence as a customer.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I ate all the fortified pumpkins and
  swift carrots I'd stocked up on in
  the village.<0 Type='4'/>Once I finish up here, I need to remember
  to go shopping in Kakariko Village.<0 Type='4'/>And while I'm there, I might as well make
  a stop at that inn.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Once I rest up, I'll be hitting the road
  again. I've stayed here too long as it is.<0 Type='4'/>Before I go, though, I need to pick up a
  ring garland as a souvenir.
Talk_2001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Not surprised you've got enough guts to
  walk around, uh, "free."<0 Type='4'/>But go find someone else to talk to,
  all right?<0 Type='4'/>I don't want people thinking I know you.
Talk_0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Fortified pumpkins and swift carrots are
  this village's signature crops, right?<0 Type='4'/>Suppose it wouldn't hurt to go try some
  before I get back on the road...
Talk_2002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, well. We meet again.
