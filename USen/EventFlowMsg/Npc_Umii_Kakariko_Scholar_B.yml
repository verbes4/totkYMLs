  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>Hm? Did Purah send you? I'm Saguru.
  Nice to meet you. I specialize in studying
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  I mean, look at all of these fascinating
  ruins just dropping out of the sky!<5 Type='1'/> Great
  stuff, right?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='18005300750072007000720069007300650053005f0030003000'/>Huh?<5 Type='1'/> Wait, you're not with the
  survey team!
  
  This is an official Ring Ruins research site.
  It's dangerous here for civilians.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>But if you're the sort of guy who comes
  all the way out here for curiosity's sake,
  you must be a researcher at heart.
  Since you're here, I'm happy to answer
  questions. Um, as long as they're about
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  Ack, rain in my eye!
Talk_Greeting0003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, I remember you... What are you doing
  out so late?
Talk_Greeting0004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Huh? What are you doing out in rain
  like this?
Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>We're not sure what lives up there, but
  we've found new species of plants around
  the fallen ruins.
  And if there are plants, I'm sure other
  things live up there too.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>If you're interested in that sort of thing...
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You know when you start daydreaming
  and stare off into the sky? And then you
  go, "whoa, a floating ruin?!"
  That's a sky island.
  
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Remnants of the Zonai civilization, like
  these <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, have fallen all over.
  Turns out they come from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Which means...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068004c00'/>The whole Zonai legacy is up there! The
  islands are untouched, so everything must
  be well-preserved.
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Try talking to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Cori<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. She's our resident
  plant expert.
  
  Right now she's trying to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cultivate plants<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  that were attached to the ruins.
Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We don't have a way to get to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky
  islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. At least, not YET! I'd love to
  go someday.
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I bet the folks in Tarrey Town could improve the
  balloon. I wish I had a reason to head northeast...<FontSize Value='100'/>
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If that interests you, you should definitely
  ask her about it.
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmm...<5 Type='1'/> I want to know more about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>armor<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  made with Zonai tech.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Clothing and culture are tied together,
  and there's so much we don't know about
  either of them. So many mysteries...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Anyway, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bigger the sky island<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, the
  bigger the settlements. We think some
  sort of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cultural relic <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>must be up there.<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>But since we can't get up there, it's all
  conjecture. I'll have to content myself
  studying the Ring Ruins.

  Goodbye.
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>This is an official Ring Ruins investigation
  site... <5 Type='1'/>And it IS dangerous for civilians...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>But I respect your curiosity.
  
  
  Since you came all the way out, I'll answer
  any of your questions. Um, as long as
  they're about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What admirable curiosity! Do you have
  any questions about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  They're my specialty.
  If I'm honest, I don't know much about
  anything else.
0016: |
  What are sky islands?
Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>I'm not boring you, am I?
  
  
  Because I can go on about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  forever! Go ahead, ask me anything!
0017: |
  Anything live up there?
0018: |
  What makes you curious?
Talk_Greeting0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, I remember you... What are you up to
  this early?
