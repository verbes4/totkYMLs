  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ore deposits<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> over there are chock
  full of it.
  
  Given the gouged-out terrain and all the
  tools and structures we've found...<5 Type='0'/>I think
  this place used to be a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk_1040: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Well, fine!<5 Type='0'/> Because you're about to go
  silent as a stone...FOREVER!
talk_1012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I mean, that's some pretty weird <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ore<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  right?<5 Type='0'/> I've never seen it on the surface.

  investigate this valley too?
talk_1013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's the same for the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>other huge valleys<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  too.<5 Type='0'/> It's just a shame we have no idea
  how to use this ore.
  But you have no need to know, do you?

  Yiga who will take you down!
talk_1042: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>The valley has evidence of civilization
  everywhere.<5 Type='0'/> I have no doubt that it used
  to be a mining area.
  All the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>other huge valleys<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are the same.
  I wonder what value those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ore deposits<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  really hold...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>Look, it's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>full of weird ore deposits<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  Between the gouged-out terrain and the
  handmade objects, this must have been
  a mine way back when.
