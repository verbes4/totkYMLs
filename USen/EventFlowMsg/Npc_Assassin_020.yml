  It's so dark around here, you can't see a
  thing without a little glow. <5 Type='0'/>So don't waste
  your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightbloom seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> like I did!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, and putting a seed on the ground to
  hit it is all right,<5 Type='0'/> but expert explorers
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>attach them to arrows and fire them<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Do that, and lookâ€”<5 Type='0'/>I can see your face in
  the dark, clear as day!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>The face of our sworn enemy Link, that is!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hello there.<5 Type='0'/> Did they send you to
  explore the Depths too? Do you have
  enough <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightbloom seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  Many of our allies are using these Zonai
  devices called "lights" lately,<5 Type='0'/> but it never
  hurts to have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightbloom seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on hand.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>You never know when a light will go out
  on you, after all.
talk_1042: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Many in our clan choose to navigate the
  Depths with those Zonai lights,<5 Type='0'/> but I'll
  take a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightbloom seed <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>any day.
  You never know when a light might fail,
  but you can always count on a seed.

  Out of brightbloom seeds...
talk_1000: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I used up all the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightbloom seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> I
  brought with me.<5 Type='0'/> If you have any extra,
  would you mind sharing?

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightbloom seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...<5 Type='0'/>and I used all of
  mine up.
  I'm sorry to ask, but if you have any on
  hand, would you mind sharing?

  Here you go.

  Getting my hopes up just to dash them?
  I can't think of anything crueler.
