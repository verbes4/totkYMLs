  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>What? What do you want? I'm... I'm busy
  right now, OK?
  
  <0 Type='3' Data='0200'/><FontSize Value='80'/>I need to make sure the voe of my dreams hears
  of my feelings for him...
  
  But how can I properly focus the positive energy—
  or put the bottles in the water—while this guy is
  loitering around?<FontSize Value='100'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh! Oh no! <5 Type='0'/>Maybe <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster guts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> aren't a
  great secret ingredient...
talk0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Look, I already told you I'm busy! If you
  absolutely have to just stand around,
  could you find somewhere else to do it?
  <0 Type='3' Data='0200'/><FontSize Value='80'/>I need to send these bottles on their way. The voe
  of my dreams must hear of my feelings...<FontSize Value='100'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>And you are not that voe!
  
  
  Get out of here!
talk0018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>But I'm sure, even when the results aren't
  perfect, my darling will happily eat
  anything I make for him!
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I told you I was busy. What part of "get
  out of here" is tripping...<5 Type='1'/>you...<5 Type='1'/>
talk0019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I would make this meal over and over and
  over again...
  
  But I've been having trouble getting my
  hands on that one key ingredient, the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hearty radish<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>However! <5 Type='0'/>For you, my darling, I will
  search far and wide until I find more.
  
  Just be patient!
talk0003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>If you've got it, that means that you must
  be... <5 Type='1'/>You have to be...
talk0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Wait a minute.
near0000: |
  Distractions...
talk0012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Aaah, I can't wait any longer! Tell me!
  Tell me you are who I know you to be!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Wait! <5 Type='1'/>Don't say anything yet!<5 Type='1'/> I am not
  ready for all that the outside world holds!
  
  I still haven't mastered all the lessons
  from the "Voe and You" class or the old
  cooking class...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You can wait a little longer for our love to
  fully bloom, can't you?<5 Type='1'/> Of course you can!
  
  OK! That's settled!<5 Type='1'/> Now I need to get
  cracking on all there is to do! <5 Type='1'/>First, to
  the cooking pot!
talk0006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, my darling, you have the most perfect
  timing! I'm experimenting with the recipe
  for a creamy heart soup as we speak!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>I just add a voltfruit, plus a hydromelon,
  and then a little fresh milk...
  
  Oh, and of course it wouldn't be complete
  without the spiritual core of the dish, a
  hearty radish. Then we stew...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>If you wait just a moment, it'll be ready!
near0001: |
  Could...could it be?
talk0007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Ah, sorry...<5 Type='1'/> Your bag is full, huh?<5 Type='0'/> I guess
  you can't carrry this, then.
talk0013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's best when it's fresh, so I'm just going
  to wait until you've got your bags all
  sorted out.
talk0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>That bottle! Why do you have that bottle?
near0002: |
  And just a pinch of love...
talk0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>I know in my heart that I am not ready for
  all that the outside world holds!
  
  But I also know you can wait a little longer
  for our love to fully bloom!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>And until that day comes, I can at least
  make you a fabulous meal or two,
  my darling!
talk0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ah, you've got your bags all sorted out?
  
  
  Great! Let me just make it for you. Give
  me a second...
talk0009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Get out of here! Scram!
talk0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>This is really packed full of my love!
talk0016: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh! Oh no! <5 Type='0'/>Maybe adding <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ore<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> doesn't
  bring as much kick as I thought...
