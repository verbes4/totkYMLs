  tablet too?
  
  The letters carved on it are ancient
  Hyrulean.
  
  The only person who can decipher them
  is a guy named Wortsworth.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>But he went to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, talking
  about documents he needed there. So
  now I'll never know what this thing says...
  Truth is, I wanted to go with him...
  It would've been a great opportunity
  to learn ancient Hyrulean myself.

  So I have to be really thorough with this!

Near_1_6: |
  I want to be able to read it.

  The letters carved here are ancient

  Even if it's just this stone tablet, I want
  to know what's written on it.
