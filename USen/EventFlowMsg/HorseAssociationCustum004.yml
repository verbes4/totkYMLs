  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Oh. Guess not, then.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>There's a big rumor spreading around the
  Stable Association, of something I think
  might be a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new animal species<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It sounds big and brutal like a bear—and
  kind of tusky like a rhino. But rumor is
  that it's not a bear OR a rhino.
  I think it's a lot more than just a rumor
  though. There's an actual <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of the
  animal's footprints<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> at one stable!
  If you see anything like a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new animal
  species<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in your travels, please, please,
  please let me know!
