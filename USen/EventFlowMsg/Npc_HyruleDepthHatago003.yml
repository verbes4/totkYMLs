  I hope I can get back to looking after

  This isn't why I wanted to work at a

  I'd be happier as a guide...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Things are a bit of a mess around here.
  If you need to use the stable, you can
  check in at the counter.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Oh! But if you have questions about
  routes through the area, then I'm the
  guide for you!
  If you're passing through here, then you
  must be heading to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, right?
  
  Allow me to offer information about my
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>regional recommendations<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, free of charge!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>If it's Gerudo Town you want, then the
  safest route is to cross <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Digdogg Bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  To get there, head right when you leave
  the stable, then take another right at the
  three-way intersection.
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>massive Zonai ruin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> fell near the bridge.
  That place is swarming with researchers.
  You can't miss it.

Talk_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Well, you'll have to get through the desert
  to reach Gerudo Town.
  
  I've heard an enormous <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has
  blown in and they're locked down tight.

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Coliseum Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  
  To get to those ruins, first face directly
  away from the front of the stable.
  
  Then take a look to the mountain that's
  somewhat off to your right. You'll find the
  ruins by crossing over it.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>When you stand right in the middle of
  the strange, circular ruins and close
  your eyes, something happens.
  You can hear the battle cry of those
  powerful soldiers testing their strength
  long, long ago.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hearing that, you can't help feeling a
  rush of adventure! I highly recommend
  going to those ruins.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Be warnedâ€”a truly vicious monster has
  settled there.
  
  You'll probably end up testing YOUR
  strength against it.
