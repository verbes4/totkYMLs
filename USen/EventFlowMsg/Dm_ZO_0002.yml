  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Thank you...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  How shameful that this should happen
  to me, <5 Type='0'/>captain of the guard at Zora's
  Domain.<5 Type='0'/> Unbelievable...<5 Type='1'/> Urp!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>After the Upheaval, that filth suddenly
  began falling from the sky...
  
  It sullied the waters around here and in
  Zora's Domain. Everyone is at their wit's
  end because of it.
  That is why I set out to investigate the
  surrounding area myself.<5 Type='0'/> To think I would
  fall prey to falling sludge myself... <5 Type='0'/>Urp!
  <4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Just thinking of it makes my scales
  bristle...<5 Type='0'/> Urgh... <5 Type='0'/>My gills still feel
  so unclean.
  If you had not sprayed me with water,
  I shudder to think what would have
  happened to me...
  <4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Please, take this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zora spear<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> as a token of
  my thanks. I am sorry that it is not much,
  but it is all I have.
  It decayed like all of the other weapons
  at the time of the Upheaval, but...<5 Type='0'/> Well, it
  is not unusable, at least!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Hm?<5 Type='0'/> Ah. You have many weapons in
  your possession, it would seem.
  
  If you make room and return, I will gift
  you this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zora spear<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
