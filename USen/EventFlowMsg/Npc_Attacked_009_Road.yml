  It'd be the worst to end my long journey

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I think you know this, but within that one
  beautiful word "mushroom," there's
  room for many varieties.<0 Type='4'/>They grow in different places... They have
  different effects...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>But each kind has its uses as you travel,

  There is no down. Never heard of it.<5 Type='0'/>

Near_StartPoint_01: |
  Anything on mushrooms?
StartPoint_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I've got to say I think it's strange that
  the newspaper doesn't devote coverage
  to mushrooms. Very odd, right?
  Mushrooms are so useful. They have all
  kinds of effects. But the paper just won't
  write about any of that.
GoRange_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>They say that a big ruin just dropped right
  out of the sky onto a hill near here!
  
  I'd like to see it for myself, but the way
  there is too steep. I can't climb it.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  What's the world coming toâ€”ruins just
  falling out of the sky? Think of the poor
  mushrooms. They'll be crushed!

StartPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The newspaper really needs to put out

  those islands up in the sky.
  
  Not that I have a way of getting there.
  Besides, I've got a long way to go just
  hunting for mushrooms down here!
Near_GoRange_01: |
  Mushrooms are so useful!
Near_BackRange_01: |
  Are they up there too?
RestPoint_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Rain is great for mushroom growth,
  just not for mushroom hunting.
  
  It's making the cliffs and stuff all slippery!
  Will it stop now, please?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>You'd think I'd be fine on this bridge.

  All the same, I'm way too scared to

Near_GoRange_02: |
  Don't look down...
Near_BackRange_02: |
  Not scared, not scared...

  many uses.
BackRange_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The thing with mushrooms is there are
  many ways to prepare them.<5 Type='1'/> Just baking
  a mushroom is very tasty.
  But they're even more delicious if you
  combine them with other ingredients.

  Who needs ruins?

  Mushrooms, so healthy!

  right on top of a hill near here!
  
  I wouldn't mind seeing it, but I can't climb
  up there, and it's dangerous. Safer to stay
  here and hunt for mushrooms in peace!
RestPoint_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Say, did you know that rain is essential
  for mushroom growth?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>But it does make cliffs and stuff all
  slippery, which really messes up my
  mushroom-hunting game.
  So while I'm grateful for the rain, I wish
  it would stop now.

  It's because of you that the mushroom-

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My sister, Nat, and I have split up to go
