  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rock-roast pond <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is a good marker to

  I guess Cooke has been having it out with
  a customer...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Cooke's pretty stubborn, so things

  I'll search around here to sniff out
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>anything strange <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>that might be happening.
  
  That leaves the other areas to you, Link!
Talk_07: |

Talk_24: |

  If you're lookin' to help folks out, you

  <3 Type='0' Data='0601'/>Which means he's probably planning some

  Knowing that, I can't leave the city yet.

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>on the north side of Death Mountain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, the
