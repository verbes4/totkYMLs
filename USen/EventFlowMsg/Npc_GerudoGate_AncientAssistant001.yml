  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Today is gonna be a good day, I can feel
  it! You can walk with me to the work site,
  if you want.
Moving_Rain: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Hm, looks like it's starting to rain.
  We should probably find some cover.
Balloon_Midnight: |
  Zzz... Zzz...
Greeting_Noon: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Hello, how are you?
Greeting_Rain: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>Welcome, welcome. Thanks for stopping
  by in this weather.
Balloon_Evening: |
  Phew. Taking a break...
Rain_Day_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>We don't investigate the ruins when it's
  raining, so I fill my time on days like this
  double-checking all the supplies.
  I like to know what I've got on hand,
  just in case I get into a bad situation.
  It pays to be prepared!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're planning to head through Gerudo
  Canyon, make sure you've prepared
  yourself and have everything you'll need.
Rain_Day_02_Thunder: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Every single lightning strike startles me!
  I completely lose track of what I'm doing
  until I recover.
  Apparently there's no lightning in
  Gerudo Canyon though...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003000'/>Maybe I should go there.
Shiny_Day_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'm investigating these ruins again today.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It's hard to believe something this big was
  up in the sky in the first place...
  
  Then again, I heard that some huge ruins
  fell into Kakariko Village as well, so there
  is probably a lot more to this story...
  A bunch of researchers have been sent
  to those ruins, so I imagine they've made
  some kind of discovery by now!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're interested in the ruins, you
  should head to Kakariko Village.
Shiny_Day_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It would be a tragedy if ruins of this size
  were left uninvestigated!
  
  We've got to really put in some effort.
  We can't have the researchers in Kakariko
  Village outdoing us.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>I won't let the temperatures in Gerudo
  Canyon get in the way of my work!
Rain_Day_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Ahhh... The sound of the rain falling is
  just so soothing, don't you think?
  
  Gerudo Canyon stays nice and cool when
  it rains...
Rain_Day_01_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>While I was double-checking the supplies,
  I realized that I've got a bit more than I
  need of something.
  Here, I'll share this with you.
Shiny_Evening_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Since I've finished up my work for the
  day, I'm taking a bit of a breather
  right now.
  <4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003100'/>There's always more to investigate,
  so it's important to grab some rest
  when you can!
  Let's do our best tomorrow!
Balloon_Day: |
  Incredible...
Rain_Day_01_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>It's exciting to run investigations and
  make discoveries, whether we're talking
  mysterious ruins or just our supplies!
Shiny_Evening_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>That reminds me... I wonder what Quince
  and the others are up to right now.
Balloon_Rain: |
  Now where is it?
Greeting_Morning: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Oh, good morning!
Sleep: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0053006c00650065007000'/>Zzz... Zzz...
Moving_Evening: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Today was a really productive day. You're
  welcome to walk with me if you like.
