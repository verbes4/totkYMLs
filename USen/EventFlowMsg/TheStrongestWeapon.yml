  Goodbye.
Talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, I'll stop boring you. <5 Type='0'/>But if you
  happen to get your hands on a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>weapon
  made with Lynel horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, bring it my way.
0015: |
  What do they look like?
0016: |
  Where can I find them?
Talk16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>A Lynel is a huge, hooved beast that
  walks on four legs.<0 Type='4'/>There are several variations. Eyewitnesses
  have reported seeing Lynels with red
  manes, <5 Type='0'/>blue manes, <5 Type='0'/>and white manes.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>I once saw one from far away. It was a
  terrifying sight, I'll tell you that much.
0017: |
  How do I fight them?
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You won't have to travel far. I saw one
  just north of here, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>near the entrance to
  Tempest Gulch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>I didn't get a close look, but there's no
  doubt that towering monster<5 Type='0'/> was a Lynel.
Talk18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Very, very carefully! <5 Type='1'/>Lynels have four
  agile legs, but they've also got two big,
  muscular arms to pummel you with.
  As if that wasn't enough, they can also
  fling fireballs from a distance.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Fighting them head-on is a recipe for
  a very, VERY bad time.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rode on its back<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> though... <5 Type='1'/>That
  might be a different story.<0 Type='4'/>The trick would be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hitting the Lynel's
  weak spot <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so that it gets low enough for
  you to climb on top.
0019: |
  Sure thing!
Talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If there's anything else you want to hear
  about Lynels, just ask. I'm an open book.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  I can tell you what they look like, <5 Type='1'/>where to
  find them, <5 Type='1'/>and even how to fight them.
0020: |
  No.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>Hey, that weapon you're holding!<5 Type='1'/>
  Let me see it!
0022: |
  No, thanks.
Talk22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hm. Well, if you ever change your mind,
  there's a reward in it for you.
Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So... <5 Type='1'/>Are you going to show me that
  weapon now?
Talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='18005300750072007000720069007300650053005f0030003100'/>That's...<5 Type='1'/> No doubt about it... <5 Type='0'/>That's a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>weapon made with Lynel horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>! 
Talk26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>And it's the horn of a Blue-Maned Lynel!
  How'd you manage that?
Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>And it's the horn of a White-Maned Lynel!
  How'd you manage that?
Talk28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>And it's the horn of a Silver Lynel!
  How'd you manage that?

  Got to get somewhere dry.

  there.<5 Type='0'/> Where did you get it?
Talk29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Nice and sharp too... <5 Type='1'/>You could slice
  through anything with this baby.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>That settles it. This is the strongest

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>I'm honored that I got to see such a

  You interested in weapons?
Near_02: |
  No way...
Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Then again, the world's a big place.
  Who knows? Maybe a stronger weapon
  is out there somewhere.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Someday I'll return the favor and show
  you a weapon of my own making!
Talk02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>No kidding? <5 Type='0'/>I make weapons too. I've
  been using all sorts of materials, trying to
  make the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strongest weapon in the world<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Nice and hard too... <5 Type='1'/>You could shatter

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>No kidding!<5 Type='0'/> Who from? It's an excellent

  I can tell you what Lynels look like,<5 Type='1'/>
  where to find them, <5 Type='1'/>and even how to
  fight them.<5 Type='1'/> Just ask.
Talk04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Of course. What swordsman doesn't?
  Well, you wouldn't happen to know how
  to make them, would you?
  I make weapons, see. I've been using all
  sorts of materials, trying to make the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strongest weapon in the world<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  never be too careful.
0005: |
  I made it.
Talk05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Tell me something. You ever heard of the
  monster they call a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lynel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>You want to go in prepared, rather than
  relying on strength alone. That's the mark
  of a true swordsman.
  Ask away. I can tell you about what Lynels
  look like,<5 Type='1'/> where to find them, <5 Type='1'/>and how to
  fight them.
0006: |
  It was a gift.
Talk35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Practicing your sword technique is
  important, but so is knowing your enemy.
  
  That's where I come in. I can tell you
  what Lynels look like, <5 Type='1'/>where to find them,<5 Type='1'/>
  and even how to fight them.
Talk07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>It's a huge beast with a body like a horse.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You wouldn't believe how many times
  I've seen someone try to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ride on a
  Lynel's back<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> only to go flying.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>I actually spotted one of their kind
  northwest of here, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>near the entrance
  to Tempest Gulch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But I wasn't about to pick a fight with a
  monster like that. Strong, agile... And did
  I mention they can shoot fireballs?
  The best I could do was turn tail before
  it caught sight of me.
0007: |
  I love weapons!
Talk36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Huh? I can't see it too well from down
  here. Mind getting off your horse?
0008: |
  I'm not interested.
Talk08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>A swordsman who doesn't care about
  weapons? Now I've seen it all.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Well, I make weapons. I've been using all
  sorts of materials, trying to make the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strongest weapon in the world<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If I could only get ahold of that
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lynel's horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>I'm sure I could make the strongest

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='14005000610069006e00660075006c005f0030003000'/>But I'm no fool. <5 Type='1'/>I know I haven't got the
  skill to take down a Lynel.<0 Type='4'/>Hmph.<5 Type='0'/> I just wish someone else would
  make the weapon of my dreams and show
  it to me. I'd give them a nice reward.
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='16004700720065006500740069006e0067005f0030003100'/>So? <5 Type='0'/>How's it going? <5 Type='0'/>Made any new
  weapons lately?
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I think with a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lynel horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you could make
  the strongest weapon in the world...<0 Type='4'/>But of course, you can't just charge up to
  a Lynel and expect to survive.<5 Type='1'/> You have to
  be careful.
  A sword's not enough on its own. You
  have to be armed with knowledge too.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>That's why I've tried to learn all I can
  about Lynelsâ€”<5 Type='1'/>what they look like,<5 Type='1'/> where
  to find them, <5 Type='1'/>and how to fight them.
