  I received an unsettling report from
  Buliara today.
  
  A strange haze—some have called it
  gloom—is emanating from beneath
  Hyrule Castle. Those who touch it fall ill...
  But my friends Link and Zelda are in
  Hyrule. I'm sure that those two can
  get to the bottom of this problem.

  A new, much more worrying report
  has arrived.
  
  Both Link and Zelda have gone missing
  while exploring below Hyrule Castle.
  
  Shortly after they were lost, the castle
  lifted off into the sky, where it was joined
  by countless small, floating islands.
  So much happening all at once...
  
  
  What is going on in the world? And...are
  those two safe?

  Things grow more and more dire across
  Hyrule, and now the danger has come
  here as well.
  A sand shroud, the worst sandstorm in
  recent memory, has covered the area.
  People are taking shelter underground.
  We traveled out to see if we could discern
  the cause of it, but we were ambushed by
  new monsters called Gibdos.
  To make matters worse, I wasn't able to
  accurately hit them with the lightning I
  can call down...
  We're inundated with those seeking safety
  from the sand shroud or the Gibdos, and
  we still don't know what has caused this.
  As the chief of Gerudo Town, I am to
  blame for these failures...

  The fortifications protecting the shelter
  are strong. There's no way the monsters
  will be able to break through.
  We're also lucky to have a good source of
  water in the shelter, but we must watch
  for invaders trying to use the waterways...
  And, as a precaution, we should cover the
  hole behind the throne.

  Sitting here feeling sorry for myself won't
  solve anything. I'm going to leave Buliara
  in charge of the shelter and go train.
  The ruins to the north aren't too far—they
  should be the perfect place for me to
  practice with my lightning.
  Despite my worries for my people, and for
  the world, I must do what I can. I know
  that's what Zelda would advise me to do.
  Oh, Lady Urbosa, if only you were here
  with us. Watch over us all in these dark
  times, and keep Zelda and Link safe...

  My head is practically spinning from all
  that's happened after Link arrived here. I
  need to write it down to keep it straight.
  First there was the battle at Kara Kara
  Bazaar, followed by our defense of
  Gerudo Town against the Gibdo attack.
  Then there was the mural underground,
  and the sudden appearance of that
  massive ancient shrine...
  We were guided there by a voice we'd
  come to learn belonged to my ancestor.
  And we made our way inside.
  There we fought and defeated the Gibdo
  queen. Then the secret stone of my
  ancestor appeared and I awoke as a sage.
  My ancestor told me what I must do for
  my people and for Hyrule, and then the
  sand shroud disappeared.
  To think all of that happened after Link
  came here...
  
  The kind of events that follow in his wake
  are truly amazing.
