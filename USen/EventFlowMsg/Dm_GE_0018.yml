  This platform connects to the very top
  of this temple.

  Use your power to charge the four
  batteries, and it will function once more.
Dm_GE_0018_Text_005_b: |
  Heed my words...

  It's calling to me...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>It said that I should use my power to

  to the top of this temple...
  
  And the voice that has been speaking to
  us said the platform should be able to
  take us all the way up there.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If that's true, we could corner the monster
  at the top. We might also figure out who
  is talking to us, and why...
