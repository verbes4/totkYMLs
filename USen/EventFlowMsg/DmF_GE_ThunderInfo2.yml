  Maybe we can hit them all with a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>single
  lightning strike<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  Here's an idea... Don't try to hit a
  specific dummy.
  
  Instead, aim for the area in the middle of
  all three, <5 Type='1'/>like <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>right around where that
  rock<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is jutting out.
  Oh!<5 Type='0'/> But keep in mind that the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farther
  away<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> a target is from me, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>longer<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> it will
  take me to build up the energy to hit it.
