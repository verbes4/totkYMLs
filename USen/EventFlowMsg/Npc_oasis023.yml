  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>At long last, it feels like the battle is over.
  We made it through, despite injuries
  and setbacks...
  But there's no time to relax! I should
  probably head to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Training Area<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> at
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Southern Oasis<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Maybe I'll relax at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Southern Oasis<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for
  just a bit before continuing on to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Training Area<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  No, I should wait until after training.
  There is no greater reward for hard work
  than taking some time to relax...

  oasis, and it is south of here. <5 Type='0'/>The name
  says as much.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Water is a rare commodity in the desert,
  and while the place isn't exactly a tourist
  hot spot, we Gerudo enjoy it well enough.
  It's actually surprisingly far away. You
  might want to rent a sand seal from the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rental shop<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to make the trek easier.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>They outnumbered us in the last battle
  and were able to break our lines, but...
  
  We won't let that happen this time!
  We're fully prepared for a long fight that'll

1001: |
  Southern Oasis?
1002: |
  Training area?
1003: |
  Goodbye.
talk0005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah. It's a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>training facility<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  set up for the town guards to use
  for training.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>For example, the battles against the
  Gibdos showed me that my stamina and
  ability to adapt could use some work.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Once I'm done here, I'm thinking of
  heading out there and working on that.
  
  Hm... The place is meant for just us
  Gerudo. Technically.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I imagine you'd be allowed to use it,
  though. You did fight alongside us.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>It doesn't matter how many they throw at
  us!<5 Type='0'/> We'll send them packing all the same!

  Time for the Training Area?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Sav'orq!
  
  
  It's important that we are able to defend
  the townâ€”we can't expect you to come
  swooping in anytime there is danger!
talk0007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>It's near the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Southern Oasis<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You could
  always go and check it out, especially if
  you're heading that way.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Ow... Everything hurts... I guess I still
  can't move...
  
  Those things... It didn't matter how many
  we took down.<5 Type='0'/> They just kept coming.
  
  Where in the world could they have been
  coming from though?
Talk_PreChallenge01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Those things... Where could they have
  been coming from?
  
  No doubt the next battle will <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>challenge
  our endurance<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> too. <5 Type='1'/>I've got to heal up,
  replace my weapon, and be ready...
Talk_InAzito: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Battle after battle against an endless
  wave of enemies that just won't stop...<5 Type='0'/>
  It really wears on you after a while.
Talk_AfterDefense: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>We beat them, every last one of them,
  yet I'm still jumping at shadows and on
  edge at the slightest noise...
