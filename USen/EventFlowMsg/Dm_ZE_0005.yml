Dm_ZE_0005_Text_018_b: |
  I do not believe it is possible to keep anything secret
  from Sonia.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_030_b: |
  He is so very dedicated. And he refuses to back
  down from any challenge.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_035_c: |
  Hearing you speak so highly of Link, I find myself
  wanting to meet him as well!
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_013_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_026_b: |
  That is not a name I have heard.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_021_b: |
  After all, you possess more than power over time.
  You have a sacred power that can dispel evil.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_004_b: |
  I might be one step closer to my era.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_038_b: |
  He must be quite the brave, courageous knight.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_033_b: |
  And his heart is good and true!
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_016_b: |
  How did you know?
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_029_b: |
  Oh? A hero, is he?
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_041_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_011_b: |
  I am sure it will become almost like second nature,
  and you will be able to find your way home.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_024_b: |
  And, of course, you must make it home safe to put
  Link's mind at ease.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_007_b: |
  You ask the object where it was, how it arrived where
  it is now, and then you coax it back to that original
  moment in time.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_002_b: |
  I apologize. I keep getting lost in my thoughts,
  thinking about how I can return home.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_036_b: |
  Indeed.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_019_b: |
  Oh, your concern is very sweet, Zelda.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_031_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_014_b: |
  You, of course, do want to get back to your time.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_027_b: |
  He is a royal knight. He had been originally appointed
  for my protection. 
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_022_b: |
  Both of these powers will help you protect your
  own era.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_005_b: |
  I see...
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_039_b: |
  What a picture Zelda paints of him!
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_000_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_017_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_034_c: |
  Ah. I can see that you have absolute faith in him.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_012_b: |
  But, Zelda...there is more on your mind than just that.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_016_ab: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_017_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_025_b: |
  Link?
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_020_b: |
  But listen. You can focus your attention on
  returning home.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_025_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_003_b: |
  With your power over time... If I were able to learn
  that kind of control...
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_010_ab: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_037_b: |
  I would also like to meet him.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_032_b: |
  He is very strong...
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_015_b: |
  But...you also desperately want to help us out
  in this era. Am I close to the truth?
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_028_b: |
  But later, he became a hero by saving both me and
  Hyrule from a great evil!
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_032_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_040_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_010_b: |
  The object's memory...
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_023_b: |
  Queen Sonia...
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_006_b: |
  The secret is to think of it like drawing out the
  object's memory.
Dm_ZE_0005_Text_001_b: |
  Are you well? You seem a bit distracted.
