  Hylian out here.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>I'm observing the clouds and the winds
  in hopes of learning the cause of this
  blasted blizzard.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I could probably learn more from a higher
  vantage. Unfortunately, flying isn't an
  option. The gales are too strong for it.

  for me. Without you there, I could never
  have gotten those supplies to the village.
  Now I'm helping Bedoli sort and give out

  blizzard, we'll need a view from up high.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>Unfortunately, with such strong gales,
  flying isn't an option. I'm stuck observing
  from ground level.

  is over, I delivered the supplies to the
  village. They ought to hold us for a while.
