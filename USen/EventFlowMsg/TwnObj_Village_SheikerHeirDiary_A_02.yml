  Monsters appeared at the Ring Ruin out
  among the hills that lead west of here,
  disrupting my research.
  Is anyone out there capable of dealing
  with something like this?
  
  I'm not from the village, so I hope it's OK
  for me to ask.

  The Cuccos used to lay their eggs in front
  of the store, but they've been wandering
  off somewhere in the mornings.
  So where are those dang Cuccos laying
  their eggs?
  
  We rely on those eggs for our business.

  I don't think I'll ever find a bed that's as
  comfortable as the stone slab in the Ring
  Ruins. It's so cool and comfortable.
  I may never be able to sleep on a regular
  bed—no matter how soft—ever again.
  
  What should I do? Guess I'll sleep on it
  and figure it out later.
