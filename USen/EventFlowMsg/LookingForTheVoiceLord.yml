  for next month, but now it's your
  spending allowance.
  Thanks for clearing this whole thing up
  for me.
  
  Right. Time to settle the ol' nerves and
  get back to work!

  horned statue...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>As there is the Goddess of light, then it
  follows that she would have an opposite—
  the horned god.
  Like light and dark, one cannot exist
  without the other—their power manifests
  through the other's existence.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Knocking a hole in the wall? That was
  fate, no doubt about it.
  
  I can't go in there, but I'll keep this area
  spick-and-span.
  
  And I'll be sure to greet the horned statue
  from here too.
  
  Oh, and thanks, you know? Take this.

  the wrath of the Goddess, fallen to ruin."
  
  Then that must mean the horned statue
  is an entity who deals in life and power!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Which would make the dais the place
  where it was enshrined, back when
  it was still a god.

  You'd think a measly broom banging into

  Please, Link. Help yourself to anything in

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But you should probably avoid this area

  Sometimes I hear a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>creepy voice <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>coming

  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>demon <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>growling or something.

  The thing is, it's always really dusty
  around here, so I work overtime to clean
  it all up.
  Well, I was working SO hard, in fact, that
  the force of my broom accidentally took
  out part of this wall.
  Ever since, I've been hearing this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>creepy
  voice <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>coming from the hole I made—it
  almost sounds like a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>demon <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>growling...
