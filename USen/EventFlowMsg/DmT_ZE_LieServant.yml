DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_011_b: |
  Your Majesty has certainly risen above your
  admirable lineage.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_024_b: |
  Just his name... Even that... It gives me pause.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_013_b: |
  
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_000_b: |
  Allow me to offer you my deepest apologies...
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_015_b: |
  All except you and your sister, that is.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_026_c: |
  For that reason, and others, I want him close.
  It will be easier to keep an eye on him.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_002_b: |
  for taking so long to accept your repeated invitations.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_017_b: |
  
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_004_b: |
  A welcome appeal, Ganondorf. I will accept your
  vow of fealty to the kingdom of Hyrule.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_019_b: |
  Your actions today are appreciated, Ganondorf.
  I look forward to your future endeavors.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_028_d: |
  There is nothing to worry about.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_006_b: |
  Receiving such an appeal from you, a hero to his
  people and a king by birth...
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_008_b: |
  It is my honor.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_021_b: |
  Your Majesty.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_010_b: |
  And now you rule as king and have taken a Hyrulean
  woman as your wife.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_023_b: |
  I believe that man's heart holds many dark ambitions.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_012_b: |
  Most impressive.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_014_b: |
  It is unfortunate that the noble Zonai no longer grace
  this world with their presence.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_025_c: |
  I am well aware of his evil nature.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_001_b: |
  on behalf of the Gerudo...
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_016_b: |
  Even if something were to happen to me, both my
  kingdom and the peace it bringsâ€”these will endure
  for generations to come.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_027_c: |
  
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_029_b: |
  OK.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_003_c: |
  It is our desire to be accepted into the protective
  embrace of your kingdom. To serve it faithfully.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_005_b: |
  I understand that a single male is born to the Gerudo
  every one hundred years.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_007_b: |
  Well, it is truly reassuring.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_009_b: |
  When your Zonai ancestors first descended upon
  these lands long, long ago, they must have seemed
  to be gods.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_020_b: |
  You may leave.
DmT_ZE_LieServant_Text_022_b: |
  King Rauru...
