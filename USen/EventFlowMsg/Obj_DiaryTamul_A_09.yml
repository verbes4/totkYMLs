  On that day, the land shook, and huge
  chasms that seemed bottomless opened
  in the ground.<0 Type='4'/>The clouds billowed and rolled as floating
  islands appeared in the skies, raining
  chunks of ruins down on us.<0 Type='4'/>And strangest of all, Hyrule Castle began
  to float in the air. It's hard to believe this
  is our world now.<0 Type='4'/>Whoever started calling it <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  had the right idea.

  Stop reading.

  An evil-looking haze surged up from the
  chasms that opened on the surface.<0 Type='4'/>The haze weakens everything it touches.
  People fall ill when exposed to it, and it
  has another curious property as well.<0 Type='4'/>As if guided, the miasma coiled about our
  weapons. There isn't a single weapon we
  know of that hasn't decayed as a result.<0 Type='4'/>We're calling the stuff <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gloom<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  We decided to call the islands hanging in
  the sky "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>." Simple and to the
  point is best, it seemed.<0 Type='4'/>I suspect, based on the design motifs on
  them, that the ruins falling from the sky
  are Zonai in origin.<0 Type='4'/>We still understand so little about the
  Zonai civilization. All we know is that it
  flourished in the sky.<0 Type='4'/>While it's true that the Upheaval has
  posed major problems in every aspect
  of life in Hyrule...<0 Type='4'/>I can't deny that it's also presented us
  with an opportunity to answer questions
  we've long had about our history. Hmmm.

  We've started investigating the fallen
  ruins and the sky islands.<0 Type='4'/>Our best lead is a report from the chief of
  Kakariko Village that some unusual ruins
  and engraved slabs have fallen there.<0 Type='4'/>I decided to have the Zonai Survey Team
  work out of Kakariko Village in Necluda,
  southeast of Lookout Landing.<0 Type='4'/>The ruins that fell on Kakariko Village are
  massive. You can see them from all the
  way here at Lookout Landing.

  The crater left by the castle's rise is still
  spewing gloom. It's kept us from making
  any progress with our investigation.<0 Type='4'/>We still don't know anything about where
  the princess and Link have gone.<0 Type='4'/>The Upheaval occurred very soon after
  Princess Zelda and Link left to explore
  beneath Hyrule Castle.<0 Type='4'/>I fear the two events are related...
