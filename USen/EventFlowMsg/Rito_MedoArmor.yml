  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Secret hot springs, huh? I've been to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sturnida Secret Hot Spring<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> a few times.
  It's northwest of Rito Village.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>It's the best! A quick soak is enough to
  heal your wounds in the blink of an eye.
  It keeps you from freezing too.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But I dunno about the others. The Hebra
  Mountains are a big place. I'm not sure
  we could cover all of them.<0 Type='4'/>But that slumbering treasure is pretty
  tempting...<5 Type='0'/>if only we could find it.
