  It took us two days to reach this isolated
  island. Though the ruins stood before us,
  we were too exhausted to explore.
  Though weary, Tauro was able to decipher
  the Zonai writing on the stone slab:
  
  "The dragon ring slumbers in the
  labyrinth's depths. Wake it, and ye
  shall receive due compensation."
  While his translation provided me with
  renewed vigor, Tauro shortly thereafter
  fell ill with fatigue.
  After seeing him off on his way home,
  I swore to tackle the ruins myself.
  
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>acorns<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>nuts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> I have prepared to

  Did you see the pillar-shaped ruin in front
