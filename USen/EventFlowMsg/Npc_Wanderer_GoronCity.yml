  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hm... We don't have enough information
  at this point, so we need to research each
  lead with scrutiny.

  Upheaval and the phenomena happening
  across Hyrule...
  There must be a connection...but what
  is it?

  hmmm...
  
  I feel certain that if we investigate them
  both, we will uncover a clue that explains
  the Upheaval.

  We're in the area after hearing there may
  be some out here.

  been sighted around here too. I hope
  they don't portend ill things ahead...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Link! I have some new information I'd like
  to share regarding the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten Temple<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  we'd spoken about.
  I spent some more time with literature
  about the temple.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>And it seems probable that within the
  temple lies a clue even more thrilling
  than the geoglyphs themselves!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>I felt more excited than a schoolboy who
  caught a fireproof lizard! I'm determined
  to unravel that clue as soon as possible.
