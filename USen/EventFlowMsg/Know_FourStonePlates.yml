Talk_01_31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004300680061007400'/>I feel bad about asking you to find all this
  out for me, since you're sightseeing too...<0 Type='4'/>But we're so close now. I need to know
  what each one of the slabs say!
Talk_01_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Y'know, <5 Type='0'/>you're a good kid to take the
  time to tell me about all this.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>I'd never be able to take a look at it all
  myself with my fear of heights.
Talk_01_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I can get a good look at the floating ruins,
  and they told me what the slab inside
  it said...
  But I'm still frustrated that the other

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>Heh. <5 Type='0'/>They're only the most amazing
  sight to see in Hyrule.<0 Type='4'/>Of all the ruins that fell everywhere,
  these ring-shaped wonders are only in
  this village. Five of them!
  They've found a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone slab with Zonai
  writing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in four of the ruins.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Those ancient messages are the main

Talk_01_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So that was the fourth one?<5 Type='0'/> I see...
0002: |
  I read what's on a slab.
Talk_01_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So did you visit the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?<5 Type='0'/> I would
  if I wasn't scared of heights.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>No one is allowed to visit the one ruin
  that's floating above the village.<0 Type='4'/>But if you've read one of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>slabs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in any
  of the<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> other four Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, tell me what
  it says!

  together...don't they sort of read like
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>one single message<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>You don't think...<5 Type='0'/> Could the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rest<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of the
  message be on a slab in the floating
  Ring Ruin?!
  But why?<5 Type='1'/> Hmm...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Oh, this is impossible. <5 Type='0'/>Trying to figure this
  stuff out is making my head hurt.
Talk_01_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>With all those Ring Ruins falling out of the
  sky, you'd hope just one more would have
  the decency to float near the ground.
  But no. <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>All four of the other ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> landed
  way up high. I take one step up towards
  them and break out in a cold sweat.
  It's not fair! I want to know what <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>those
  stone slabs say<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
Talk_00_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'll be checking out the shops around

Talk_01_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh, well. At the end of the day, I learned
  a little something about our history.<0 Type='4'/>Thank you for everything!<0 Type='4'/>From one sightseer to another, I'd like
  to reward you with one of my personal
  favorite travel necessities.
Talk_00_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>The problem is...<5 Type='0'/>I have an extreme fear
  of heights. My legs start shaking if I'm
  even on the second floor of a house.
  And every Ring Ruin fell somewhere
  high up...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>One of the ruins is floating above part
  of the village, so at least I can see it
  from below. 
  The other four though? Forget about it.
  I can't even get close.<0 Type='4'/>I wish I could find out <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>what's on the stone
  slabs <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in each of those ruins...
Talk_01_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Those are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>thunderwing butterflies<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>I caught these unusual insects on my
  travels through the Faron region. They
  only come out in the rain!
  You can boil them with monster parts to
  make an elixir that grants you resistance
  to electricity.
  Remember that! It'll come in handy on
  your travels, take it from me.<5 Type='0'/> All right,
  then, I'll see you around!
Talk_00_06: |
  They're all so high up...
Talk_01_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Back in ancient Hyrule, people called
  "sages" protected the kingdom... I see...<5 Type='0'/>
  How fascinating.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I bet those sages were nearly as strong
  and wise as Princess Zelda herself.

  But what's on each of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>slabs in the

  killing me!
Talk_01_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>So in this ancient battle, the king and
  all the sages fought the Demon King, but
  they couldn't defeat him.
  Still, they tried to leave a glimmer of hope
  behind for the people of the future—
  for us.
  That's really something.<5 Type='0'/> Huh.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800530075007200700072006900730065004d005f0030003000'/>H-hey, you don't think the Upheaval is

Talk_01_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>So it's not enough to be exceptional—
  you need a secret stone to be a sage...<5 Type='1'/>
