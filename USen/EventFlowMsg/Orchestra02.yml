  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>All right!
  
  
  My beat didn't reach the bees, but I
  guess it got you moving!
  
  With these, I can whip up a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>honey
  crepe <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for the conductor of my troupe
  on the double.
  Here's a little something for helping me
  out. Take it. All yours!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What did you say? The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stable Trotters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  are back in action?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Then what am I doing here? They need
  me to bring the rhythm!<0 Type='4'/>I don't know where they are, but if I hit
  up every single stable, I'll run into them
  sooner or later.<0 Type='4'/>It shouldn't be long before I can offer the
  troupe leader my services again!
Talk_4010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I am hearing that, then...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  Maybe it's the one I'm destined to
  walk through life with, calling to me in
  that way!
  But it can't be... It just can't be...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I wonder where it's coming from. I've
  been scouting here for the source, but I
  haven't found it yet.
Talk_3005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm gonna beat it and head back to my
  band leader.
  
  I play with a group called the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stable
  Trotters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. We bop around from stable
  to stable, sharing our tunes.
  I'll bet everyone's back at our old meeting
  spot, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Woodland Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  It's way north over in Eldin, so I better get
  a move on.

Talk_4011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What? You can't hear it? So that means
  the sound I'm hearing...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Maybe it's the secret sound of the one
  I'm destined to walk through life with.
  Could it be so...<5 Type='0'/>calling just to me?
  I've got to find who it is!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I'll keep searching a little longer. I hear it
  somewhere right around here...
Talk_1002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Whoa!
  
  
  Hey, hey, don't interrupt! I'm busy calling
  bees with my beat.
  
  ...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Come on! <5 Type='1'/>Don't look at me like that!
  
  
  I know it's goofy, but I gotta try.
  
  
  See, the conductor in the musical troupe
  I play in has been a little down.
  
  I figured I'd make him <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>honey crepes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  That should cheer our Mastro right up!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But I can't get my hands on any <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>courser
  bee honey<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. How am I supposed to make
  honey crepes without the honey?
  That's why I'm trying to lure some bees
  with my beat.
  
  All I need are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>three combs of honey<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
Talk_3006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Wait a second!
  
  
  What's that I smell? Something sweet?
  Hey, maybe... In your pouch there...
Talk_4012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's a little hard to hear in this rain, but
  the sound is a lot like a drum...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Maybe it's the one I'm destined to walk
  through life with, calling to me in this
  mysterious way!
  I'm sure that's it. I think so anyway.
  
  
  Maybe I'll have better luck finding where
  it's coming from after the rain stops.
Talk_1003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'll bet my beat can bring those bees!
Talk_3007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Huh. But I'd know that scent anywhere.
  I love that stuff...

  time! See you!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Someone said there are some beehives

  But that hole is pretty scary. No way I'm
  going anywhere near there.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Whoa! You again, huh?
  
  
  This isn't a good time. I'm busy calling
  bees with my beat.
  
  ...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Hey!<5 Type='1'/> I can see that look on your face.
  It's messing with my flow!
  
  Look, I get that I'm probably not gonna
  bring any bees here like this.
  
  But the conductor in a musical
  troupe I play with has just been
  a little down lately...
  So I need three globs of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>courser bee
  honey<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for a surprise. How else am I
  gonna get it?
Talk_4005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This rain drowned out the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sound of the
  drum<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> I heard earlier. I thought I could
  make it out, not that far away.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'll look for the source later. Better to
  take shelter from the rain for now.
0001: |
  What are you doing?
Talk_4006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>That sound... <5 Type='1'/>I wonder if it that really is
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>drum<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> out there...<0 Type='4'/>I thought it could be close, given how
  loud it was, but where's it coming from?
0002: |
  I'll...leave you to it.
Talk_2003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh* I get it that this probably isn't
  gonna work to bring bees here.
  
  But I just gotta get <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>courser bee
  honey <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>somehow.
Near_4000: |
  Is that a drum?

  beedum. <5 Type='0'/>Aaand...honey!<5 Type='1'/> Hm?
Talk_4008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You hear that? It's coming from around
  here somewhere. Is that...<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a drum<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Talk_2005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>I heard there are some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>beehives<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> around
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the north, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>near

  But that hole is pretty scary. No way I'm
  going anywhere near it.
0004: |
  Here, have some honey.
Talk_4009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>That sound...<5 Type='1'/> I wonder if it's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the sound
  of a drum<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> after all.<0 Type='4'/>I think I hear it getting louder or quieter
  as I walk around. That could help find
  where it's coming from...

  <4 Type='0' Data='0e00480075006d006d0069006e006700'/>Hear that beat? Beedum!

  It's not that...

  I hear it!

  I don't hear it.
