  devices. Removing them will not
  hinder my research.
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Hmm. For this concentration of Zonai devices to
  have fallen, could they still be in production in the
  sky islands? <5 Type='0'/>Is that even possible?<FontSize Value='100'/>

  have to request the retrieval of additional
  Zonai devices.
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Still, for this concentration of Zonai devices to have
  fallen, could they still be in production in the sky

  Now, what's in the sky?

  application as a form of luminescent guidance?
  
  I can only speculate, of course, as verification of my
  hypotheses is impossible.<FontSize Value='100'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The Zonai devices here all fell from
  the sky.
  
  I've surveyed various regions, but I
  haven't seen devices in this quantity
  anywhere but Tarrey Town.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>My research into practical application is
  progressing well! I've studied the Zonai
  civilization for a long time.
  To us Zonai-obsessed research team
  members, this place is paradise.

  Removal will not hinder my research.
  
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Hmm. For so many Zonai devices to be concentrated
  in one area, could they still be in production on the
  sky islands? <5 Type='0'/>Is that even possible?<FontSize Value='100'/>
Near_0005: |
  We'll request more.
