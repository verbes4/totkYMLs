  Gerudo Desert Lookout Post—Logbook

  Don't read.

  The desert has been as calm as I've ever
  seen it for quite some time now. No raids,
  no monster attacks, no bandit incidents.
  I should be happy about that, but it's my
  job to keep an eye out and report any
  events that are out of the ordinary.
  And when nothing is happening, I have
  nothing to do. But no matter how quiet
  it gets, I can't leave my post.
  I know how important this task is, but
  that doesn't keep me from getting bored.
  I should be grateful for the peace...

  I've gotten word that this lookout post is
  going to be shut down.
  
  I was worried that it was because I hadn't
  been doing my job, but it turns out that
  wasn't the case at all.
  It's actually because they are building a
  lighthouse to help Kara Kara Bazaar and
  Gerudo Town to communicate better.
  The task of watching for anything unusual
  will be moved there, so there's no reason
  to maintain this lookout post.
  I hear the lighthouse will be gigantic so
  that it is visible in the worst sandstorms
  the desert has to offer.
  It's a bit exciting to imagine a beacon of
  hope shining over Kara Kara Bazaar that
  we could look to in a disastrous storm.
  I can't wait to see the lighthouse
  in person!

  Today is my last day in the lookout post.
  I'm a bit sad saying goodbye to this place.
  
  But! I've been asked to supervise the
  new training area being built at the
  Southern Oasis.
  I feel honored to be trusted with training
  our soldiers. It's a direct way to help keep
  the desert safe...
  I've learned a lot from watching over the
  desert here—it's time to put it to use by
  teaching others what I know!
