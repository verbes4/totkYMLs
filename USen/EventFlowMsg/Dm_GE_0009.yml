  nearly impervious to attack.

  to where I am...
Dm_GE_0009_Text_003_b: |
  But it's not only the one hive... There are
  three to deal with, each just outside the
  town gates.
Dm_GE_0009_Text_001_b: |
  There's a Gibdo hive... Just like the one
  that appeared near Kara Kara Bazaar.
Dm_GE_0009_Text_003_b_00: |
  I don't need a clairvoyant sand seal to
  know a massive Gibdo attack is coming.

  protecting Gerudo Town from the
  enemies at our gates.

  our chance to strike.

Dm_GE_0009_Text_006_b: |
  But when they open and begin releasing
  Gibdos, they're vulnerable.

  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Both the hive and those tornadoes were

Dm_GE_0009_Text_017_b: |
  We must prepare for battle.
Dm_GE_0009_Text_009_b: |
  Come...
Dm_GE_0009_Text_015_b: |
  I thought... It's nothing.
Dm_GE_0009_Text_007_b: |
  The Gibdos won't wait outside our
  walls forever...
Dm_GE_0009_Text_013_b: |
  "Come..." Is it calling out to us?
