  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thanks to you, Link, the frame has the
  picture it deserves. The stable has a
  whole new feeling with it here.
  The giant white stallion is a symbol of
  hopeâ€”that there's always a chance any
  day something great can happen.
  Oh, such as...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>What if someone rode up to the stable

  There's an unnatural black cloud over

  It hasn't moved since the Upheaval. Not

  I hear you can find them in the village, so
  why don't you go there if you want one?
  
  Kakariko's northeast of the Skyview Tower

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You can buy one of these decorations
  in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's a little far, but
  I'm sure you can manage.
  Just go northeast from the Skyview Tower

  village soon enough.

  I'm not showing you.

  You'll see a village in the valley.
  They sell these decorations there.

  A painting of that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>giant stallion <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>would go

  I want to leave it as is.

  the stable the other day. Just a small one,
  thank goodness.
  Apparently it was started by a young
  flute player who was staying with us.
  I heard he set off fireworks as a prank.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Hmph. Can you imagine? I haven't seen

  There used to be an ominous black cloud
