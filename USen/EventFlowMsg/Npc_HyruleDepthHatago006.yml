  the hero be here?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>If a pretty lady is in distress, the hero will
  arrive to save her. Everyone says so!
  
  So this is entirely expected!

  you've sorted out your belongings.

  How stylish!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But, well...that's strange. The hero's
  supposed to carry a legendary sword.<0 Type='4'/>And you, um, don't have a sword at all.
Near_0000: |
  Tee-hee... Will he come?
Talk_0006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But...that's strange. The hero is supposed
  to carry a legendary sword.<0 Type='4'/>And that weapon on your back? It doesn't
  look legendary at all. Not even when
  I squint.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh, please! <5 Type='1'/>Don't waste your time talking

  fashion sense—is your own, but...<0 Type='4'/>I simply can NOT be guilty by association
  of the fashion crimes you're committing
  right now.
Talk_0007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, I'm just playing around. I know that
  the hero isn't real.<0 Type='4'/>I mean, the REAL hero would be carrying
  the legendary Master Sword, and...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  That sword you have there...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>The M-M-M-Master Sword?!<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh, you almost had me for a moment
  there! That is an amazing sword, of
  course, so it took me by surprise.
  But there's no way you're running around
  with something straight out of a story.
  That'd be just too convenient!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Tee-hee! Careful, folks will <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>think you're
  part of the Yiga Clan<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> if you wear the
  complete set!
  But these tights are so nice, a little
  coordination of any kind could really
  snazz up your look.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Thanks for coming to save me, really.
  
  
  You might not be the hero, but you are
  my prince!

  I was worried for a moment that my

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I guess the hero is just a fairy tale.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Me? I've been making outfits for the Yiga
  Clan since they kidnapped me.
  
  I mean, I like fashion, but I couldn't even
  sew! Did they listen? No, of course not.
  
  It wasn't so bad once I got used to it
  though. Honestly, I've been getting a
  little attached to the outfits I make.
  Attached enough that I don't want to
  hand them over to the Yiga Clan, anyway.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>This isn't my size, but it might fit you.
