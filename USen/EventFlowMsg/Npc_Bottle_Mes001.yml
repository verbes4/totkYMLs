  Ugh, and those stones are blocking the
  road. This isn't good...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>Ha, what do you know. Never thought I'd
  run into a fellow traveler here.<5 Type='1'/> You look as
  determined to get through as I am!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>Well, <5 Type='0'/>I don't know exactly what happened
  here, but...
  
  There's some mysterious gunk and giant
  stones blocking the path. All the way
  to the domain, it looks like.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>But if I can somehow manage to beast my
  way through...I'll probably get really buff!

  bridge, I'll finally be at Zora's Domain.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>Looking back...<5 Type='1'/> I'm amazed I was able to
  make it through that dangerous path.
  
  I'm a merchant by trade, but I would
  never take on such a perilous journey
  just for work.
  After all, whether you move forward or
  turn back, there are always customers
  to be found.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003100'/>What's really important is who is waiting
  for me after I overcome this challenge!
  I did all of this for her.
  I'm sure you know the feeling.<5 Type='0'/> You must
  have journeyed through the gunk to see
  someone important as well, right?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003000'/>Heh, you don't have to answer that. Just
  tell your important person I said hi!

  usual spot.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Many travelers turned back. <5 Type='0'/>Of course
  they would in a situation like this.
  
  If you're not a bird or a fish, you have to
  follow this path to get to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zora's Domain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Sometimes all you can do is give up.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>But...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003100'/>I HAVE to get there!
  
  
  Finley is waiting for me at Zora's Domain!

  I'm on my way!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Looks like I got here first. <5 Type='1'/>I wonder if
  Finley is on her way...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003100'/>Finley is waiting for me...<5 Type='1'/> I'll find a way to
  Zora's Domain no matter what...
  
  No matter how long it takes!
near04: |
  I wonder if I'm too early.

  to Zora's Domain...
  
  When my muscles stop aching, I'll keep
  going. Can't overdo it or they won't grow,
  after all.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003000'/>You be careful out there!

  Zora's Domain!

  I need a break...
