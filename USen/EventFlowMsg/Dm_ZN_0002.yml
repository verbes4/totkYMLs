  major ruins from the age of legends...
  
  They're as good a place as any to start.
  If we just searched all of Hyrule randomly,
  we'd probably never find the sage.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>So Princess Zelda was in the distant past

  can't ask her what the plan is supposed
  to be.<0 Type='4'/>And she can't be here to fight with
  us either...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_65: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I'm sure this is the lead we were hoping

Dm_ZN_0002_04_68: |

  up to you. You're critical in all of this, so
  when you're ready, we will be too.

  us down!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_69: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Princess Zelda entrusted her hope to us.
  Together, we will see this through.

  was actually an impostor!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>And the reason she appeared at Hyrule
  Castle was so the Demon King could lure
  Link into a trap...

  We cannot afford to stand still at a time
  such as this. It is imperative that we act!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_11: |
  Water...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_53: |
  There's no mistaking that what you all
  saw at the castle was the Demon King
  from the legend of the Imprisoning War.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_12: |
  Lightning...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>And time... That was the princess.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_54: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>You four go back to your homelands and
  gather information about ruins that might
  be related to the remaining sage.
  Linky, search around and see if you can
  find any other undiscovered leads!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/><4 Type='0' Data='18005300750072007000720069007300650053005f0030003000'/>Oooh!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_55: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Each of you awakened as sages at ruins
  from the age of legends, right?
  
  Maybe the remaining sage is in a
  similar location.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800530075007200700072006900730065004c005f0030003100'/>That's it!
  
  
  There was one more sage back then!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_56: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What? You've already found a clue about
  the fifth sage?
  
  Sage Mineru? And...Zonai Ruins in Faron?
  
  
  Why didn't you mention that sooner!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>So, then, that means that Princess Zelda
  isn't actually here?
  
  Instead, she's in the distant past and not
  in the present... Right?
Dm_ZN_0002_04_57: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a00410064006d00690072006100740069006f006e005f0030003000'/>The Zonai Ruins in Faron, huh...
  
  
  It's likely that there are ruins from the
  age of legends in that region as well.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='2000440065007400650072006d0069006e006100740069006f006e005f0030003000'/>Exactly!
  
  
  One more sage that might be here now!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_58: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oooh. So then, the fifth sage must
  be there!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_40: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a0055006e006400650072007300740061006e0064005f0030003000'/>Heh, I don't know what else to say
  except well done!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>It is amazing that even trapped in the
  past like she was, Zelda still had a plan.
  
  Everything she did was to heal and
  strengthen the Master Sword, which will
  be critical to defeating the Demon King.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_59: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>The path forward seems clear.
  
  
  Linky, we'll leave it to you. You should
  head for the Zonai Ruins in Faron
  and investigate!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_41: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>And she sent a message to Link to visit
  the Deku Tree...
  
  Then our first Master Sword clue lies with
  the Deku Tree.
  
  Princess Zelda sacrificed herself to
  restore this sword for the sake of Link
  and everyone else in this era.
  It is the key to defeating the Demon King.
  We must find it at all costs!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That's right. It's clear what we need to
  do now.
  
  Link, head for the Deku Tree, and search
  for the Master Sword!<5 Type='1'/>
Dm_ZN_0002_04_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><1 Type='3' Data='5a000000'/>I seeee. So, to summarize...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_43: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='22005100750065007300740069006f006e004e006f0072006d0061006c005f0030003100'/>Didn't you say the Master Sword
  disappeared?

  anything to help with these troubles
  everywhere in Hyrule.<0 Type='4'/>But it's all connectedâ€”the Upheaval, the
  problems our homelands have been
  facing, the fake princess.<0 Type='4'/>It's all happening because the Demon
  King came back!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_44: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>With everything in order, all that's left to
  do now is defeat the Demon King!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Yes, we should consider that to be the
  case, bizarre as it sounds.
  
  It also seems that Princess Zelda was
  trying to somehow defeat the Demon
  King in the past...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_45: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>I cannot fathom the sheer strength of will
  that must have required...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Our ancestors made a vow to Zelda...
  
  
  They swore that when the Demon King
  was revived, their descendants would
  awaken as sages and fight alongside Link.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_46: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>So Princess Zelda was in the distant past
  all alone, doing everything she could to
  help us.

  told me...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  It appears the princess was making
  preparations in anticipation of the
  Demon King's revival in this era.
  There must be some hint we still haven't
  figured out here in our time.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_47: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a0055006e006400650072007300740061006e0064005f0030003000'/>...<5 Type='1'/>

  Demon King other than the fact that he's
  bad news and super strong.
  What do we do...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_48: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='260050007500720061006800540061006c006b0053006500720069006f00750073005f0030003000'/>Everyone, hurry back to your homes and
  prepare for the final battle. I'll sound the
  alarms once Link is ready.
Dm_ZN_0002_04_72: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>An island floating in the sky, and Zonai
  ruins in the Depths...
Dm_ZN_0002_04_49: |

  I'll leave taking care of Sage Mineru to
  you, Link!
Dm_ZN_0002_04_33: |

  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>Oh! Wait...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>You said that six sages were with King

  on, Link...to finish what Princess
  Zelda started.
  Now, after everything she's done, the
  rest is up to us.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Hmm. But without any leads...
