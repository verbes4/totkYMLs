  After the old fellas get back, I'm sure

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>On and on you go with your "best defense

  in stock.
  
  The old fellas who stock this place haven't
  come back from chasing off monsters.
  
  They're up at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruin <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>that's among

Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>I don't care how many times you say it,
  "the best defense is a good offense" is
  still nonsense from back to front...
  And now look at us. It's late at night!

  And now, here we are. The sun's
  gone down!
Talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>While you've been going on and on with
  your poppycock about offense being

  We're stuck here until you see reason!
  We need to clear out those monsters!
Near03: |

  those monsters because you keep spittin'
  all your foolish talk!
  There's no way that defense is better
  than offense!
  
  You know what? I'm done! You can just
  go off and "defend" yourself all you want.
  I'm not going to be worm food.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Those two... They just don't get along.
  That's going to stand in the way of them

  It's been prized since old times, and it's
