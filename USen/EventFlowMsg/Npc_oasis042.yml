  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The Gibdos may be preparing to attack as
  we speak.
  
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new unit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> needs to be ready to meet
  them in battle. Otherwise, it'll be like the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>first encounter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> all over again...
1002: |
  What's the new unit?
talk28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Hey! Voe!
  
  
  If you need something, talk to me!
  
  
  I don't want you getting in the way of the
  sword-and-shield unit, OK?
1003: |
  Goodbye.
talk16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>I hear there's some kind of strange event
  going on around <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kara Kara Bazaar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Tch... We need to get the new sword-and-
  shield unit trained ready for action.
talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'll have to treat everyone in the new unit
  to a drink at the canteen. They've earned
  it, that's for sure.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Wait... <5 Type='1'/>What am I saying? We're not done.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>While we've successfully defended the
  town, we aren't out of danger yet.
  
  Make sure you don't lose focus either!
talk18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But after learning an entirely new way to
  fight, all the members of our new sword-
  and-shield unit deserve a little break.
  I'll invite them all to meet at the canteen
  soon! It'll be my treat!
TerrorArrow: |
  C-cut it out!
Near00: |
  Show them our real power!
ThunderHelmet: |
  That helm...
TerrorFire: |
  S-stop it!
talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah. The first time we fought the
  Gibdos, they had us on our heels the
  whole time...
  Numbers and strength were on their side.
  The best we could do was an organized
  retreat to protect the civilians...
  Most of the guards that held the Gibdos
  off are still recovering from their injuries.
  
  Hopefully this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new unit <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>can help us
  avenge our comrades and return to the
  surface. But first they must finish training.
talk21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, the Gibdos did a serious number on
  us before.
  
  It was so bad that some of the guards
  who fought in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>first encounter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are
  still recovering from their wounds.
  I believe that partly has to do with how
  hard it is to protect yourself while using a
  spear. Both hands are full, you see.
  So I've established a new unit that will
  use a sword and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> instead. They can
  better guard themselves that way.
talk22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>In that first encounter... Well, if <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  hadn't been there with her <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>control of
  lightning<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, we might have been wiped out.
  All the more reason to get the new unit
  ready. We have to keep <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> safe.
talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you've got something to say, please
  make it quick.
  
  After our humbling <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>first encounter <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>with
  the Gibdos, I realized that we needed to
  establish a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new unit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to combat them.
  The new unit is in the middle of training.
  They need to get into fighting shape fast
  since the enemy could strike at any time...
TerrorBomb: |
  Ack! What?!
TerrorExplosion: |
  Nwaaah!
talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's fine if you're going to fight alongside
  us. Just try not to get in the way.
  
  The best thing to do is make sure all our
  defenses are ready for what's coming.
talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I'd wanted to attach <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>electricity-emitting
  material <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to our weapons, kind of like Lady
  Riju's ability...
  But they're rare, valuable items that have
  to be taken from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Electric Lizalfos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>So instead, we'll try using <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>materials that
  generate fire<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Maybe those will work?
  Here's hoping...
talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Haha! It looks like the flames are pretty
  effective! We'll burn up these monsters!
talk26: |
  We did it!
talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>That was a brilliant battle! <5 Type='0'/>Everyone did
  their part to keep the town safe!
  
  I'm especially proud of our new sword-
  and-shield unit. The idea, and the hard
  work of those guards, paid off...
TerrorSword: |
  Calm down!
1001: |
  First encounter?
talk27: |
  Time for that drink!
talk14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sure, we've saved the town, driven off
  the Gibdos, and the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has
  passed... But we cannot relax!
  Or at least, we cannot completely relax...
