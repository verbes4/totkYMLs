  I don't know why, but I do...

  the rain, but I guess that's not true for
  you, huh?
  I don't mind getting rained on either, but
  a lightning storm... Best not to get caught
  in that.

  you continue the search.
  
  I believe in you! Give it everything

  I laid eyes on that strange rock. Like
  something bad was going to happen.
  But I never would have expected this!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Part of my job as a guard was to keep an
  eye on that strange rock, but...I never
  expected it to be a Gibdo hive!

  I possibly could...
  
  <FontSize Value='80'/>Could that be why the Gibdos woke up? N-no,

  for our lives together in Kara Kara Bazaar.
  I'd be a bit sad if you didn't remember...
  Speaking of remembering, I never got a
  chance to express my gratitude for your
  help back then. Sarqso.
  Oh, I guess I should get used to speaking
  your language while I'm out here, huh?<5 Type='1'/>
  Ahem. Thank you.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>What do you think? My pronunciation was
  spot on, wasn't it? <5 Type='1'/>I hope soâ€”I learned
  the phrase and practiced all the way here!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Even though there was no way to know it
  was a Gibdo hive... Stabbing it recklessly
  was a terrible idea in retrospect.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><FontSize Value='80'/>That's got to be why the Gibdos woke up. <5 Type='1'/>But maybe
  not... <5 Type='1'/>I hope not...<FontSize Value='100'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'd always thought of Hylians as small,
  calm people. Now I've learned that you
  are also loyal, skilled weapon crafters!
  <4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Those traits are admirable to any soldier.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/>Oh, whoops.<5 Type='0'/> I'm keeping you, aren't I?
  
  
  You're here because you heard the rumor,
  right?<5 Type='1'/> Get going, then.
BlackZelda_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>From here, I can just make out the pattern
  on Hyrule Castle's flags, but that's it...
  
  Maybe I should've spent some time
  training my eyesight rather than focusing
  solely on spear practice...
BlackZelda_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>I heard there was no sign of Princess
  Zelda within Hyrule Castle...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>We can't give up though. She must be
  out there somewhere.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If someone had told me years ago that I'd

  to avoid the rain, but not you, it seems.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>Oh, I understand. This is how committed
  you are to finding Princess Zelda.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='1400410064006d00690072006100740069006f006e00'/>Admirable. <5 Type='0'/>But watch out for lightning.<5 Type='0'/>
  Finding the princess is important, but you
  need to take care of yourself too.
