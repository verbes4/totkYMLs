  live out in the desert.
  
  You can catch one if you are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>really, really
  sneaky<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, but even if you pull that off, the
  sand seal will bolt the moment you let go.
  The wild ones are difficult to handle!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Unlike the wild sand seals, ours have

  They're calm, well-behaved, and adorable.
  They can also carry things for you if you

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>It's pretty cute that they're so timid, but

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I can sell you one if you want, or you can
  use one of your own. Regardless, you
  definitely want a shield.
  If you buy a shield from me, it'll bring the
