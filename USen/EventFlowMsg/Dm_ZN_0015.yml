  Link... Zelda's chosen protector...
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_023_b: |
  My name is Mineru. I am the
  Sage of Spirit.
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_024_b: |
  I am happy you have arrived. At last we
  can speak with each other.
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_025_b: |
  Unfortunately, I no longer have a body...
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_026_b: |
  Without a physical form, we cannot yet
  speak face-to-face.
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_027_b: |
  But...do you see the four storehouses
  in the area?
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_028_b: |
  I would ask you to visit each of them and
  assemble a body for me.
Dm_ZN_0015_Text_029_b: |
  This is my request to you, Link, loyal
  swordsman to Zelda.
