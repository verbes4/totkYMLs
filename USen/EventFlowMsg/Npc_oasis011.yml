  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm taking a little break from helping out
  at Vaba's shop.
  
  I'm on my way to listen to the lessons
  my big sister Kalani is learning in class!

  Am I early?

  Maybe today is the day!

  to the mouth, and the mouth is where I'd
  be speaking from if I talked to that voe!
  I-I-I've got to hurry to the "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Voe and You<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>class <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so I can ask how to talk to voe!
near0008: |
  I wish they spoke louder...
talk0036: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, but it's my bedtime now. Can we talk
  tomorrow instead?
talk0024: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Hey now! Did you completely miss what
  I said before?
  
  My granddaughter still has a lot to learn
  before she can talk to a voe. How about
  leaving her be?
talk0011: |
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>It's no use. I can't hear anything they're saying
  from here.
  
  I just wanted to listen in on the<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Voe and You<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> class<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  and learn a bit.
  
  But if I go into the classroom, Ms. Ashai will
  definitely see me and kick me out.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I even thought <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hiding with the voe dummies <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in there
  would fool her, but my outfit looks different from
  theirs, and she spotted me.
  Maybe I can find a way to hide in the classroom
  without being so obvious?<FontSize Value='100'/>
near0009: |
  No luck today.
talk0037: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, but I gotta be somewhere right now.
  Can we talk later, please?
talk0012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I really want to listen in on the class and
  learn a bit...
  
  Maybe if I try to sneak in and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hide with
  the voe dummies<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, it'll work out better
  this time?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I dunno. I'm still not dressed anything
  like they are, so I'd probably get
  caught again.
