  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sorry, didn't see you there. I was pretty
  deep in thought about these ruins.
0003: |
  Ring Ruins?
Talk_41: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hi there.
  
  
  I was captivated by the sight of the ruins
  in the glowing daylight.
Talk_31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hi there.
  
  
  I was captivated by the sight of the ruins
  glistening in the rain.
0004: |
  Goodbye.

  Ugh, it's cold...
Talk_42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hi there.
  
  
  I was captivated by the sight of the ruins

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>These ruins are very unusual.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>They're unique among all the ruins that
  our survey team has discovered. On the
  surface, at least.
  We need to investigate it fully, but most
  of the team is at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. We're
  stretched thin these days.
  We'll have to make do. The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>very important<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, after all.

  Is it true?
Talk_43: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hi there.
  
  
  I was captivated by the sight of the ruins
  in the moonlight.
Talk_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>See those ruins over yonder? Those are
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—at least the ones we can
  see from here. Impressive, right?
  But the ones here are important too.
  Unique among all the ruins!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Still, ever since the Zonai Survey Team
  found <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone slabs inscribed with Zonai
  text<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> at the Ring Ruins...
  our leader has been spending all of his
  time there, and he took most of the team
  with him.

  Fascinating...
Talk_34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Those ruins fell all over <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  far off in the Necluda region to the
  southeast.
  They're called the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> because,
  well, they're still partially intact and are
  in the shape of rings.
  You can't see them from here, but climb
  up high at Lookout Landing and you
  can make them out on the horizon.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>But these ruins here are special too.
  Truly unique...
  
  Still, the Ring Ruins hold something
  mysterious that's got the attention of
  the Zonai Survey Team's leader.
  He's there looking into <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone slabs
  inscribed with Zonai text<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and he took
  most of our team with him.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Those ruins fell all over <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  The village used to be a quiet place,
  and kind of isolated up in the mountains.
  Almost a secret in some ways.
  That's all changed. It's far busier now.
  All sorts of people go there to see
  what's happened.

  There's something here...
Talk_37: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You sure are interested in this ruin,
  aren't you?
  
  Well, right now, most of the survey team
  is far away at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>The whole team is stretched thin, so our

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Even if people saw someone at the castle,
  I kind of doubt it was Princess Zelda...
  
  Unfortunately, it's too far to see from
  here.<5 Type='1'/> You'd probably need a telescope
  to get a good look, really.

Talk_39: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hi there.
  
  
  I was captivated by the sight of the ruins
  in the gentle morning light.
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I was prepared for plenty of danger when
  I joined the Zonai Survey Team.
  
  But that doesn't mean that scary things
  aren't still scary, you know?
