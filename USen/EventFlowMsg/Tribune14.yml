  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>And we finally had a breakthrough...
talk07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>We needed to make some educated
  guesses with our story, more than we'd
  normally do, but...
  I'll stand by this piece. We know our
  princess, after all. She had to have
  everyone's safety in mind!
  I'll get to writing all of this up for the
  paper.<5 Type='1'/> You take care of yourself.<5 Type='1'/>
talk08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I want to figure out why the princess
  decided no one could use the well.
  
  I'd go right in and scope it out if I could,
  but my body won't fit. We need more
  details for the story!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The sun's going down, so we'll have to
  resume our work here tomorrow. Time
  to hit the hay... Oh, that's right.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This stable's shut down. No more beds...
talk19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's getting pretty late, so we'll have to
  resume our work here tomorrow. Time
  to hit the hay... Oh, that's right.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This stable's shut down. No more beds...
talk00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Hello there, partner! What's brought you
  all the way out here?
  
  I'd heard that visitors stopped coming
  to this stable, so this place had to shut
  down. But here you are!
talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>The changes in temperature here aren't
  nearly as extreme right now. Leave it to
  you to know just when to come through.
talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Look at this—already the sleepy hours of
  early morning! Maybe I'll just hit the hay
  for a few quick winks... Oh, that's right.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This stable's shut down. No more beds...

  Why would she do this?
talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>The temperature is really scorching my
  feathers. But just look at you, kid.
  Cool, calm, and collected.
talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Why did the princess go and ban everyone
  from using the well?
  
  The owner here has no idea. He's just as
  puzzled as anyone else.
  
  I can't even go down that well to take
  a look for myself. My wings just get
  in the way.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I wish there was some way we could get
  more details.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>So, what'd you find in the well?

talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00430061006c006c00460061007200'/>Partner! I heard monsters down there.
  Are you OK?
talk03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>So, there were a lot of monsters behind
  that pile of rocks...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I can't help thinking the princess knew
  about that monster den.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>She must have had a barricade put up to
  seal away those creatures and protect
  everyone here.
  Now, why the princess didn't say so...
  That's a mystery. But maybe she wanted
  to keep any panic from spreading.
  Or maybe it was only a very temporary
  measure. But then she disappeared.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Yep, a little speculation on my part...<5 Type='1'/>but
  that's gotta be the story here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>What do you say? Holds up, right? Our
  job is to follow the facts, and that's where
  they take us.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>What's that? When you broke through the
  rocks blocking up a cave...monsters came
  scrambling out?
  Partner! That's bad—real bad. You can't
  just flap away from here now. We've got
  to do something about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monsters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  This stable has enough trouble as it is
  without those creatures swarming around
  at the bottom of the well.
talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00430061006c006c00460061007200'/>Partner! Are you all right?
talk05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I've come to this stable because my
  sources were chirping about a problem
  with the well here.
  Actually...<5 Type='0'/>they say <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> caused
  this problem. She shut down this well
  and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>declared it off-limits<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But without its water, this stable couldn't
  keep travelers, horses, or the workers
  refreshed.
  The well also provided a steady <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>supply of
  mushrooms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to folks here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So why'd the princess want everyone
  to stay away from it? That's the big
  question. What we're short on is answers.
  The owner—who's stuck here—is just as
  puzzled as anyone else.
  
  And I can't weasel down the well to see
  what she was so concerned about.
  My wings are too wide.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Ugh!<5 Type='1'/> I wish there was some way we
  could get more details. But seems like
  the deadest of dead ends to me.
talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>The newspaper's reputation is on the line
  too. Imagine what people would think if
  they learned we helped ruin this stable.
  Before you flap off, we've got to do
  something about those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monsters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
