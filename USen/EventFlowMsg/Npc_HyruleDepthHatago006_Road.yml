  Well, I heard that there's a hidden shop

  very thing!

  They supposedly sell heat-resistant

  But if guys aren't allowed into Gerudo

  And where would they even sell it?

  If you want some that's tailored for a man,
  you'll have to find a secret shop in a town
  that explicitly forbids men.
  You really have to wonder what kind of
  shop can operate like that. Makes me
  even more curious to find it!
