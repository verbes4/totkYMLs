  I think you know how to catch them...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>So if a horse isn't warming up to you,

  different abilities?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>First off, there's strength. The more stars
  a horse has in that, the less likely it is to
  lose its life.
  You'll also want to keep an eye on its
  speed, as well as its stamina, which is
  how many times you can spur it on.
  And then there's pull. That tells you how
  good the horse is at towing things.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>If you attach a harness, your horse can
  tow stuff for you. So the more stars it has
  in pull, the better!
  Lastly, don't forget about your bond with
  the horse. If it's too low, your horse might
  run away, so...
  You gotta show your horse love by riding
  it lots, soothing it lots, and feeding it lots!

  temperament from the pattern on its pelt?
  
  Horses with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>spots <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>are docile and easier to
  tame. That makes them easier to catch.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Ones that are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>one color<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> with no patterns
  tend to be wilder and more difficult
  to tame.
  But they're faster and stronger, and you
  can spur them on more!
