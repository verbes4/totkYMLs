  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>I need to do something to keep my hands
  warm! It's hard to hold the paper when
  they keep going numb from the cold.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Hmmm... <5 Type='0'/>It says that there's no confirmed
  connection to the ominous blizzard that
  suddenly appeared over Hebra Mountain.
  So really, they haven't figured anything
  out yet. That's not reassuring at all.

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rito Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> off to the west.<5 Type='0'/> I'd imagine
  that's where they'd find answers...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You get used to the cold after a while,
  I imagine.
  
  Eventually I'll get better at reading the
  newspaper with my chilled digits, haha.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Mysterious giant clouds, and an endless
  blizzard... This could absolutely be related
  to the Upheaval.
  I can't shake the feeling that there is
  more going on in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rito Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the west
  than just a bad storm...
