0003: |
  Goodbye.
Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thanks again for your help when I was
  stuck in those ruins over in Faron.
  
  If you hadn't come by, I'd sure be hungry
  by now!
Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Anyway, after that I met up with my
  friends to wrap up all the Skyview Tower
  maintenance requests.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>We stayed in all sorts of places, but we
  kept hearing about the incredible food at
  Bedrock Bistro.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>The timing was perfect, so I had to come
  give it a try.
Talk_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And wow! I definitely recommend it.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I can't wait to tell Sawson and Billson
  how good it is...
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>OK. <5 Type='0'/>Later!
NakedPlayer: |
  Trying the hot springs?
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>But I've been waiting for ages, and the
  food hasn't shown up.
Talk_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I would have liked to spend some time
  off with Sawson and Billson.
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I've heard the owner arguing with other
  customers.<5 Type='0'/> I'm getting kind of worried...
Near_01: |
  The food's still not ready?
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sawson is a friend from work. We started
  climbing Death Mountain together...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But he wanted to continue on to the
  Goron Hot Springs, so we split up.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>I told him there were plenty of hot springs
  around, but he wasn't having it. <5 Type='0'/>No, only
  special springs for him!
Near_02: |
  Hoo boy. I'm stuffed.
0000: |
  Sawson?
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Billson is a friend from work. He's a Rito
  carpenterâ€”if you're looking for him, keep
  an eye out for his headband.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I invited him, but he's a picky eater.
  Said he wasn't interested.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>He's a stubborn one. Even if he's
  starving, there are some things he
  won't eat.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>He flew off south, saying something about
  eating fish.
0001: |
  Billson?
