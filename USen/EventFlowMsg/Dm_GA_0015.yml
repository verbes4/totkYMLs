  This world should be shrouded in darkness, not
  bathed in insufferable light.
Dm_GA_0015_Text_008_b: |
  You witness a king's revival.
Dm_GA_0015_Text_002_b: |
  All these weak, peace-loving cowards
  running rampant...
Dm_GA_0015_Text_009_b: |
  And the birth of his new world!
Dm_GA_0015_Text_002_c: |
  
Dm_GA_0015_Text_003_b: |
  It would have been more...satisfying to overcome a
  worthy foe.
Dm_GA_0015_Text_004_b: |

  to be.
Dm_GA_0015_Text_005_b: |
  I will crush any opposition. I will rule.
Dm_GA_0015_Text_006_b: |

  How disappointing...
Dm_GA_0015_Text_007_b: |
  Do not look away.
