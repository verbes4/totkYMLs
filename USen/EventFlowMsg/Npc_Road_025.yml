  nasty bout of food poisoning, aren't you?<5 Type='0'/>
  Fancy running into you again.
  Our mistake was using monster parts in
  cooking. They're supposed to be mixed
  with bugs to make elixirs.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>What were we thinking?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Taking a morning stroll? <5 Type='0'/>It's soothing,
  isn't it, the warmth of the morning sun
  on your face.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I wonder if <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bugs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> can feel the sun on
  their faces.
Talk_0013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Taking a midnight stroll? <5 Type='0'/>I know how
  you feel, being drawn out of bed by
  the moonlight.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I wonder if <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bugs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> look up at the moon.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You've more energy than I, going out on
  a midday walk. <5 Type='0'/>The sunlight's already
  wearing me down.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I wonder if <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bugs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> get tired in the sun.
Talk_0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, sorry. I've got bugs on the mind. I'm
  hoping to catch some and mix them with
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster parts <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to make a few handy <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>elixirs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Bugs blend in with nature, so you can't
  always see them at first glance.<5 Type='1'/> But
  they're all around us.
  Crickets are often lurking in patches of
  grass, for instance.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And the bug I'm looking for now, the
  rugged rhino beetle, likes to perch on
  tree trunks.<0 Type='4'/>If you see one, be sure not to make any
  sudden movements. <5 Type='1'/>Bugs scare easily!
  
  Be kind and gentle when you catch the
  little guys! Do it lovingly!
Talk_0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I think about bugs so much, I'm starting
  to feel a bit like one myself.

  Bugs...aren't food...

  Down to the skivvies, hm?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Going on an evening walk? <5 Type='0'/>When the sky
  turns deep red like this, I always feel like
  doing that too.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I wonder if <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bugs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> feel the same way?
Talk_0016: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You've got gumption, taking a walk in
  the rain. <5 Type='0'/>As for me, I don't like my clothes
  getting squidgy.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I wonder if <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bugs <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>like the rain, or if they
  prefer to stay dry like me.
Near_0003: |
  I'm working up an appetite.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0053006c00650065007000'/>Joute, <5 Type='1'/>no... <5 Type='1'/>Moblin guts...<5 Type='1'/>go in elixirs...
Near_0011: |
  Hope it clears up soon.
Talk_0025: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I will say, they're shyer than usual today.<5 Type='0'/>
  Maybe because of all the noise above the
  treetops? What is that?
Near_0006: |
  I could use a break.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Lots of bugs are nocturnal. <5 Type='0'/>And if you
  want to catch a nocturnal creature,
  you've gotta be one.
  That's why I'm going to bed nowâ€”so I can
  lay hold of a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rugged rhino beetle <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>tonight!
