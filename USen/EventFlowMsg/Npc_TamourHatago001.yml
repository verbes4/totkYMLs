  Good thing the Stable Trotters are back!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thanks for sending those monsters

Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>With the pirates gone, I've got a lot of

  I wonder when I'll be able to take the

  They waited this whole time for me

  After I'm done here, I'll treat them to a

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004300680061007400'/>My thoughts tend to dwell on the god of
  horses, not some rumored beast.
  
  But from what I've heard, the rumor is
  traveling among the stables. I'll admit I
  know nothing at all about this beast.
  There's a picture of it hung up at
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>South Akkala Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, however, if
  you want to see what it looks like.

  If it's the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rumored beast <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>you want to
