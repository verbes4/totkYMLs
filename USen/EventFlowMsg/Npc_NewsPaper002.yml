  It's really a Dondon...

  Lakeside Stable?!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Dondons, huh? I guess the rumors about
  a beast were way off the mark, then.
  
  Heh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little
  sad. The rumors about the beast were a
  lot to live up to.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>On the bright side, I now know just a bit
  more about the world. Thanks for sharing
  that info with me!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/><5 Type='0'/>Hm. I wonder what is going on with
  those people in their underpants
  outside...
  It's really strange, but I don't want to ask
  what they're doing. That just seems like
  it would be incredibly awkward.

  actually the tracks of a new species called
  Dondon, and...
  Wait a minute...

  talking to.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I've just been so excited about the
  Dondon after hearing about it. I can't help
  but bring it up with everyone.
  <4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>I mean, I'm not just bringing it up out of
  the blue or anything.
  
  I only mention it to people who check
  out the picture.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>But... Well, you're the one who told me
  about it in the first place, so I wouldn't be
  telling you anything new, huh?
  <FontSize Value='80'/>So embarrassing.<FontSize Value='100'/>

  underpants seem to have vanished.
  
  Maybe it's finally time I try to visit the
  Lucky Clover Gazette and see what
  working there is like!

  you're still interested in the tracks a
  Dondon leaves? You must really be a fan!
  I still can't believe it was around
  Lakeside Stable...
  
  I doubt I'll find any wandering around
  here, no matter how hard I search...

  but you seem interested in that picture.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>It is an unusual sight, isn't it?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>That is, in fact, a picture of the tracks of
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rumored beast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  
  Rumors about that creature just keep
  traveling from stable to stable, and from
  person to person.
  You might well find someone at any
  stable spreading these rumors.

  after all?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>It's apparently the footprint of that
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rumored beast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I've even done a little searching around
  the Eldin region. I was hoping I'd be the
  one to discover what this beast is.
  But I didn't find anything. It must not be
  around here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>The idea of anything unknown—or that's
  yet to be identified—makes me excited.
  Like a new species!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>It's really wonderful to be able to learn
  about the world just by hanging around in
  a place like this.
  Lucky Clover Gazette is a big part of that
  too! Maybe someday I'll go visit them and
  see what working there is like.
