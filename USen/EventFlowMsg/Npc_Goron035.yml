  He looks just like how he's painted on the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hudson Construction<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> sign. Which helped
  me figure out just who he is.
  Then I saw him, but he was yammerin'
  away, so I waited and, uh, fell asleep.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Anyhoo, a buncha <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai devices <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and
  other stuff fell smack on top of their
  construction <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>workshop<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Heard they could use a hand getting
  things back up and runnin', so I came
  on out to help.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>But seems I'll have to keep waitin', since
  Hudson's still at it...

  I caught wind they need help clearing the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai devices<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and debris, so here I am.
  
  But, uh...you're kinda scrawny. Sure you
  can help with all this?
  
  The stuff keeps comin', so it's quite the
  task. Grueling physical labor, y'know?
