  I'm sorryâ€”I did not intend to startle you.
Dm_OP_0035_Text_002_c: |
  It was I that spoke to you earlier. That arm
  originally belonged to me.
Dm_OP_0035_Text_003_c: |
  Forgive me for appearing to you in this
  manner. Unfortunately, I no longer have
  a physical form.
Dm_OP_0035_Text_004_c: |
  In any case, that arm should allow you to
  open this door. It seems to have lost the
  power to do so.
Dm_OP_0035_Text_005_c: |
  Ah, of course. Why not visit the shrines
  on this island?
Dm_OP_0035_Text_002_d: |
  I am Rauru.
Dm_OP_0035_Text_004_d: |
  You might be able to restore it, but you
  would need to enter a place filled with
  sacred light...
Dm_OP_0035_Text_000_b: |
  That door will open only to those with
  sufficient power...
Dm_OP_0035_Text_007_b: |
  The shrines... Yes, I am sure they are
  the key.
