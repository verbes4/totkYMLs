  Some sort of Zonai figure must be

  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>This scene shows that there's a whole

  But what really caught my attention is
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the way they're oriented<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Each figure is
  pointed toward the next one in the series.
  Until it ends with that last statue facing

  be one of the Zonai.
