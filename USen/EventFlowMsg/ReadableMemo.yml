  I have succeeded in riding <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a horse made
  of bones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>! It has some kind of fancy name.
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stalhorse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, perhaps?
  On the surface, witnesses report seeing it
  only <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>at night<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. I saw it up there, just once.
  
  Ever since, I've wanted the chance to ride
  that horse. I never thought I'd get that
  chance in the Depths.
  However, it must be some kind of demonic
  beast. It ran through <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gloom <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>without
  even noticing.
  I need to practice so I don't get thrown
  off again. As soon as I recover, I'm going
  to find another one.

  Last night I dreamed there was <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a big
  snake soaring through the sky<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Out from a chasm it came...and into a

  I put on my best disguise until it passed.
  If I ever really saw something that big,
  I'd probably faint. I'm glad it was just

  While the Depths remain key to our
  mission, I admit the surface team has
  proven to be helpful.
  They have achieved some success in
  acquiring Zonai devices and intelligence—
  key to Master Kohga's grand vision.
  In addition to our Gerudo hideout, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>three
  new branches<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> have set up operations and
  are extending our influence.
  I heard they're in some old hut on the

  And they've also managed to occupy the

  Everyone has been ordered to carry a
  medicinal herb called a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sundelion<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> at all

  This order is based on intelligence stolen

  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sundelions<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> have shown promise as a

  This region has a surprising number of

  active here.
  Relics named <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai devices <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>are regularly

  It will remain a mystery. All we know is
  that each device has its own power

  It would be folly not to harness this power
  for our own designs. We must find a way

  Recently, Master Kohga has been devoted

  It's rumored that this power can <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>make

  Easing our exploration of the Depths is

  The heat is unbearable.
  
  
  This is miserable. Absolutely scorching.
  Why are the Depths under Eldin so hot?
  It isn't like this anywhere else.
  There must be lava down here. While I
  haven't encountered it myself, I can't
  think of another reason for this heat.
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stable climate<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is one of the few perks to
  being down here. The Hebra Depths are
  barely even chilly, so why am I frying?!
  For my next assignment, I'm going to ask

  Eldin. Surely there's a spot in Faron...
  Do you know what the Faron Depths

  Everything we do must be in service to

  mine <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>crystallized charges<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>crystals <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>seem to contain a mysterious

  A missing member returned to our base

  We asked how they achieved this feat so

  On a previous intel assignment in
  Gerudo Town, I overheard an old legend,
  passed down for generations.
  It begins, "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Under the site of the arbiter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  in the darkness of the subterranean
  depths, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lies a great treasure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."
  Obviously, when that kind of legend fails
  to yield any treasure for years, it tends to
  fade from public consciousness.
  So now that searchers are few and the
  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>subterranean depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>" beneath the
  Gerudo Desert are open to us...
  it would seem the perfect time for me
  to swoop in and secure that treasure...
  If not for the second part of the legend.
  "Whosoever seeks this treasure must
  overcome their fear, as they will be met
  by a vortex of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wrath of the executed<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."
  I know that I must take this opportunity,

  Some of the huge roots growing from the

  by <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>collectors<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> who want to chase off
  competition.
  Glory to Master Kohga.

  I'm hungry.
  
  
  All this turnover has led to a supply
  shortage in the bases. Do you know
  how hard it is to find a banana?
  The Depths are a complete wasteland.
  Nothing around here seems in the least
  bit edible.
  You'd think that everyone would take that
  seriously and respect the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ingredient<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>food <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>stock, but NO.
  That wretched new recruit ate a whole
  shipment of bananas the moment I took
  my eyes off of them.
  From now on, I'm keeping my own supply.
  
  
  Glory to Master Kohga.

  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>abandoned mines<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are productive. We
  found not only crystallized charges but
  also <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone figures called constructs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Most have fallen apart, but some appear
  largely intact.
  
  Master Kohga is excited by their potential.
  He says if we can get them to work, we'll
  be closer to a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>spectacular new power<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  He sent a reconnaissance team to a
  location in south Hyrule Field called the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Abandoned Central Mine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  If Master Kohga's predictions are correct,
  the day we achieve our ultimate goal may
  be close at hand!
  Glory to Master Kohga.

  The survey team sent to map the Depths
  has noticed an anomaly—some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>terrain
  resembles locations on the surface<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  It is not a perfect match, however.
  Further investigation is needed to
  determine if there is a pattern.

  The only known way to enter the Depths
  is through <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chasms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. After the Upheaval,
  many chasms appeared across Hyrule.
  When navigating the Depths proves too
  treacherous, try leaving and returning
  through a different chasm.
  To fully conquer the Depths, we must find
  every entrance. Unfortunately, locating
  chasms is not always straightforward.
  It is rumored, for instance, that a chasm
  has somehow opened inside a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Surely this is not the only concealed
  entrance. There may even be holes that
  do not seem to be chasms at first glance.
  But take heart—the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gloom<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that leaks from
  these pits acts as a beacon, and most can
  be seen from above.
  Glory to Master Kohga.

  There's something odd about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wall
  stretching from the floor to the ceiling<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  It looks artificial—not natural at all.
  But there's no <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>entrance<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and I can't blast
  my way through.
  
  I'm sure there's some kind of treasure
  inside. How can I reach it? I can't dig.
  Maybe I should try the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>surface<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> first...
  If I remember right, I feel like there were
  some similar man-made ruins on the
  surface called "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lomei<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>" or something.

  We have received reports of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sounds
  coming from inside the large wall to
  the southwest<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Specifically, they're coming from the
  striped wall that extends up to the ceiling.
  
  We have searched the Depths for some
  sort of entry point, but to no avail. Were
  the sounds a figment of our imagination?
  Or could it be that there's an entrance
  somewhere else? If only we had a map
  of this place, we could know for sure.
  Glory to Master Kohga.

  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>secret hot spring<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> was recently located
  in a valley in the Hebra Mountains. I found
  that curious, given that most are in Eldin.
  However, upon being dispatched to this
  area, I discovered the spring's source—a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>waterfall of flowing lava<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the Depths.
  Put plainly, this is confirmation of a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>connection<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> between the Depths and
  the surface.
  Where else might these connections be?
  Maybe there's more to discover in this
  place than I initially thought.
