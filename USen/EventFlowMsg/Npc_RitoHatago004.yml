  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This place was once a stable. And I was
  once its owner.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>But when that terrible cold wave rolled in,
  it froze up our business along with the
  rest of Hebra.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Which is why the stable closed down...
  and the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lucky Clover Gazette <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>bought out
  the place shortly after.
  I thought I'd try to help out around here
  for a while. It's not like I have anywhere
  else to go.
  But it's a lot of work I'm not used to, and
  I'm still sort of fumbling through learning
  it all.

  at the end of the day, nothing beats
  settling down with a roof over your head.
  Now that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>we can go into the archives<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  I get the feeling I'll be sleeping a lot

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Perhaps due to the abnormal weather,
  there's been an explosive increase in
  Hylian pine cones.
  They're oily on the inside and burn
  really well.
  
  Too well, in fact. I tossed one onto the
  fire for kindling, and the force with which
  it burned whipped up a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>whirlwind<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Which in turn sent all of the freshly
  printed newspapers flying far, far away...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We're through the worst of that terrible
  weather now, but it brought something
  interesting with it...
  An explosive increase in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hylian
  pine cones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  
  Those pine cones are very oily on the
  inside and burn something fierce.
  
  I learned that the hard way by tossing
  one onto the fire. It burst into flame so
  ferociously, it whipped up a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>whirlwind<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Which ended up taking all of the freshly
