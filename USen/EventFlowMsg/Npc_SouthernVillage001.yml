Talk_0021: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>If you haven't even heard of it, I can't
  expect you to know its fate.
  
  Lurelin Village is on Hyrule's southeastern
  coast. It's a small fishing town.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>I used to run an inn there, until a gang of
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pirates<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> descended upon us.
  
  I fled all this way with nothing but the
  clothes on my back.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Fair enough. I can't expect you to know
  anything about my little fishing town on
  the southeastern coast.
  *sigh* While I'm glad I found refuge in
  the desert, away from those pirates, I do
  miss the ocean...

  Never mind.

  A bed.
Talk_0025: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This place is safe enough. The sand

  But who's going to chase away the

  I'll do the salt spa.

  lurking about.
  I don't know what to do with myself now.

  Salt spa?

  Until morning.

Talk_0031: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>It feels safe here, at least, with all the
  soldiers around to protect us.
  
  I just can't help but wish my village had
  been so well defended.
  
  Then maybe the monsters wouldn't have
  taken it over...
Talk_0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>A bed at the inn will cost <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>20 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  our salt spa! It uses soothing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rock salt<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  Lurelin Village?

  I can't expect you to know about such a
