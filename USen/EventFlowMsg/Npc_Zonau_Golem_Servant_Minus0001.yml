  to the southwest. I suspect that he is
  referring to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>former Gerudo Mine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  That place flourished with activity long
  ago like this one. Ore was constantly
  unearthed and refined.
  There are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>statues that point the way<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to
  the Abandoned Gerudo Mine. Follow them
  to reach that destination.
