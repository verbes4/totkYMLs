  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I don't think there's a reporter anywhere
  else in Hyrule who makes the kind of

  It really goes to show you how much
  Traysi... I mean, how much the newspaper
  values you.

  I'd better make sure Traysi hears the

  something to do with fabrics.
  I know, I know. <5 Type='0'/>I'm basically giving you
  an extra job by handing over this fabric,
  but still...
  The point is that, by accepting and making
  use of it, you can show that you're
  officially part of the Lucky Clover Gazette!
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It would be nice if Traysi handled things a bit more
