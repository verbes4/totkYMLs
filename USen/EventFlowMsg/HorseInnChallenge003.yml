  might possibly be a truly amazing
  discovery. Probably.
  And contraptions like this one have shown
  up in places other than just Tarrey Town.
  <0 Type='4'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in Necluda, south of here,
  has one.
  <0 Type='4'/>And there's one in the southwest too—at
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Digdogg Bridge <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>near the entrance to the
  Gerudo region!

  investigate the other contraptions!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But before that, I feel the need to
  ceremonially award you for your
  big discovery.

  fallen ruins.
  
  It's rare and was never seen before the
  Upheaval, so its properties are something
  of a mystery.
  But there's a research team studying
  the plant in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—that's to
  the south of here in Necluda.
  If you want to learn more about it, you
  might try talking to them.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Anyway, I'm off to more big adventures

  I'm not going to let you go without some

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I wonder if it will break if it gets wet in

  for this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sundelion <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>I meant to give you.
  Why don't you make some space and
