  My beloved husband always gives it his
  all when working in service of others.
  I admire that about him.
  He's been working himself to the bone
  ever since being granted the honor of
  guarding Lady Impa.
  I wish for him to always be in good health
  and good spirits.
  
  That's why I made him a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>tough
  meat-stuffed pumpkin <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>using
  fortified pumpkin and fresh meat.
  I was thrilled that he kept saying it was
  tasty and going back for more! I hope it
  filled his heart as well as his stomach.

  My little Cottla. My perfect girl. I love her
  so very much. She truly is the apple of
  my eye!
  Speaking of apples, she seems to have
  quite the taste for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hot buttered apple<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  She's like an adorable little squirrel,
  always stuffing her cheeks full of them!
  
  If I could, I would cook endless amounts
  of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>apples<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>goat butter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to keep my
  little one happy.

  Koko is my precious treasure. As a sibling,
  she's an absolute sweetheart. She cares
  so deeply for her little sister.
  Ever since Cottla was born, Koko doesn't
  ever whine or complain anymore. She is
  so strong and so wonderful.
  Luckily, Mommy knows that Koko loves
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>energizing honeyed apples<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  It's a tad difficult to collect honey, but
  so long as I carry <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fire <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>with me, the bees
  won't attack.
  I would go to any lengths to see my
  Koko's smiling face. Even a few bee
  stings here or there are well worth it!
