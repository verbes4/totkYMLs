  you're coming into your own!
  
  Voe can be very alert to the words we use
  to describe things, and it can really help
  both of you learn if you're meant to be!
  Describing an experience as "magical"
  captures how you feel about it. <5 Type='1'/>That
  openness can be a double-edged sword...

  pretend to be someone you're not!

  By mentioning sweets, you captured both
  the stomach and then the heart of the voe
  in one swift move!
  And you kept your own needs in mind,
  splitting the crepe in half and not simply
  giving him the whole thing!

  Voe aren't normally allowed in town, so it

  That class is for the older Gerudo.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>The daytime class is for the younger

talk0071: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I'm sorry if that worried or scared you.

  recently graduated from this class.
  
  They've set out to explore the world and
  possibly find the voe of their dreams, but
  they aren't exactly seasoned travelers...
  I hope they're OK. Last I heard, they were

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>OK, listen. Sometimes people with a
  special connection can learn the subtle
  hints of their partner's words or actions.
  They learn that "this" really means "that,"
  or they can tell when their partner says
  they're fine but they actually aren't.
  You and I do not have that kind of
  connection. When I say you cannot
  come into the daytime class...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Hmm. <5 Type='0'/>I wonder if it's too early to be

  They like to suggest that vai join them in
  activities, but they don't always want you

  Strangely, sometimes they want to feel
  like they earned your company...

  Sarq for the Noble Pursuit before.

talk0036: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>A voe's behavior can tell you a lot about
  the kind of person he is.
  
  It's important to know that voe are
