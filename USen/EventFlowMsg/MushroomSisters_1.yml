  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>C-could it be you have some brightcaps?!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I really, really want <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightcaps<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and

  we traveled ALL this way. We need to
  gather those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brightcaps<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> inside at least.
  That's what we came for, and you can

Talk_00_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Nat, please... I just can't do this. At least,
  not with this cave.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>There are lots of other caves opened by
  the Upheaval. Let's try a different one.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>This one is surely full of...<5 Type='1'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>creatures

Talk_00_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0041006e00670072007900'/>Then go by yourself, Nat.
Talk_01_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Well, I can't blame you. Brightcaps are
  beyond useful, and they're found growing
  only in caves.
  We've got to get some ourselves.

  How about you make some room and
