  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey! Fella! What're you thinking, strolling
  into this war zone?
  
  You must've seen the "Beware of Gorons
  Goin' Wild for Primo Red Rocks" headline
  in the paper, right?
Talk_0019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm callin' my book "Douma's Guide to
  the Unknown."
  
  The first part's a deep dive into the lost
  underground city of Gorondia. I'll leave
  no stone unturned!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>So whaddaya think, huh?<5 Type='1'/> Sounds pretty
  great, right?
Talk_0007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Aw, geez. I hate to let this slip, but since
  you want to know sooo badly, I guess I
  can let you in on it.
  We all know Gorons lived underground
  way back when, but the particulars are
  still a total mystery. A great one, even!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>All we know is the place's name...
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gorondia<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  And you're lucky to even get that! Ask
  most Gorons and they'll tell ya they don't
  know a thing.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But am I gonna let that stop me? No!
  Because I'm an awesome reporter!
  
  I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
  great mystery and turn it into an even
  greater book!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>"Douma's Guide to the Unknown" is
  gonna fly off the shelves. Time to start
  practicing my signature!
Talk_0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>As a knock-your-socks-off reporter,
  there's no mystery I can't solve.
  
  Heh heh... Just gotta perfect my signature
  for when the book comes out.
Near_0002: |
  No way.
Talk_0009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>You're lyin' through your teeth!<5 Type='1'/> If you
  really read the article, you wouldn't be
  here in the first place!
  "Goron scams are rampant these days,
  so <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>-bound travelers should
  exercise caution."
  How do I know that quote off the top of
  my head? 'Cause I wrote it, bud! I'm
  Douma, the famous reporter!
Near_0003: |
  Gorondiâ€” Huh?
Talk_0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>First off, I should probably try to find a
  Goron who knows about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gorondia<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
Near_0005: |
  A mysterious city...
Talk_0021: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I ain't got time to snooze!
  
  
  I gotta find me a Goron who knows
  somethin' about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gorondia<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Near_0006: |
  Simmerstone Springs next?
Talk_0023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Hey! Now's the part where you're
  supposed to ask, "The great mystery?"
Talk_0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='18005300750072007000720069007300650053005f0030003000'/>I heard a Goron talkin' about Gorondia,
  so I tailed him here. But, uh...
  
  Is...<5 Type='1'/> Is this really Gorondia?!<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>No, right? Kinda felt like a "no" when I
  was tailin' him... <5 Type='1'/>I mean, any way ya slice
  it, this is Mine-Cart Land.
  Maybe the whole rumor was a buncha
  bunk to begin with.
  
  Now what do I do?<5 Type='1'/> I told my news agency
  that I was chasin' a huge lead just before
  I came here, and this ain't huge.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That's it!<0 Type='4'/>There's Mine-Cart Land, the hot springs,
  the YunoboCo stores... Whole
  lotta stuff to see around here.
  Makes you wish ya had a guidebook for
  Goron City, huh? Maybe one written by
  your favorite reporter?
  Gonna have to update my book's title
  though. How 'bout, "Douma's Guide to
  Goron City"?
  Yeah, that'll do. That'll do just fine!
Near_0007: |
  Now that's a deal.
0000: |
  What headline?
Talk_0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'll forget about Gorondia for now.
  Mine-Cart Land here has inspired
  me to write a guidebook!
  I'll cover this place, the hot springs, and
  the YunoboCo gem shops too! Oh, and the
  book needs a title change.
  Goodbye, "Douma's Guide to the
  Unknown." Hello, "Douma's Guide to
  Goron City."
  Yeah.<5 Type='1'/> That's the stuff.

  I even read the article!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The water's clear and colorless...with a
  slight volcanic smell. A nice, long soak is
  sure to melt your *yawn* fatigue away.<5 Type='1'/>
  How am I supposed to write about fatigue
  when I'm this tired? Maybe I gotta hit a
  hot spring myself.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The closest option's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron Hot Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to
  the south, but maybe I'll check out those
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Simmerstone Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> I've heard about.
  I've heard they're in a place called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gorko Tunnel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, which is even <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farther
  south<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> than Goron Hot Springs.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>But I've never even seen that tunnel!
  How's a gal supposed to get refreshed?!

  The great mystery?
Talk_0013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Heh heh...
  
  
  YunoboCo stores sell ore for half the
  normal price.
  
  In the city, they sell diamonds and
  sapphires... But along the road, they
  sell rubies and flint.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/>Wait! <5 Type='1'/>Half the normal price? That's a
  steal! I better stock up before I head
  back home.
Talk_0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So what's your story? Gettin' in some
  Goron City sightseein' now that it's nice
  and peaceful again?
  Ah, I get it. You saw the big "YunoboCo
  Reborn!" headline plastered all over the
  papers, didn'tcha?
0003: |
  What's Gorondia?
Talk_0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Checks out! Article probably gotcha all
  curious, huh? Hard to keep away after
  reading a quote like...
  "Marbled rock roast, which drove Gorons
  batty, is no more! Apologetic YunoboCo
  announces efforts to rebuild the city."
  The news is great and all, but the writing?
  Mm! That really drives it home. And you
  know who wrote it? Me!
0004: |
  Goodbye.
Talk_0016: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Huh?<5 Type='1'/> You're kiddin' me. Don't you read
  the papers? Here, lemme give you a
  sample of this peerless reporting.
  "Goron scams are rampant these days,
  so <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>-bound travelers should
  exercise caution."
  And ya see who wrote that? Me, Douma,
  reporter extraordinaire! What, you've
  never heard of me?!
Talk_0017: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Eh, but that's yesterday's news. Time is
  money, and I ain't rich enough to spend
  it talkin' to some random stranger.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>I gotta get back on the trail of the great
  mystery! It's something so secret that
  nobody has figured it out!

Talk_0018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Huh?<5 Type='1'/> No foolin'? I figured everyone
  woulda heard by now, but here's a little
  snippet to give you the rundown.
  "Marbled rock roast, which drove Gorons
  batty, is no more! Apologetic YunoboCo
  announces efforts to rebuild the city."
  And y'know who wrote that piece?<5 Type='0'/>
  This lady. <5 Type='1'/>So try pickin' up a newspaper
