  None of us pay much attention to his conducting.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><FontSize Value='100'/>It was our conductor who established the
  troupe to brighten up the lives of people

  for musicians. We wouldn't be here
  without him.<0 Type='4'/>For that, and for being a joy in so many
