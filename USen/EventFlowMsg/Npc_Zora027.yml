  massively miscalculated. The young ones
  have saved us all!
  I am, of course, speaking about our brave
  King Sidon. However...
  
  My son, Rivan, and my granddaughter,
  Dunma, have also become so dependable.
  They are like brand-new Zora!

  panic surrounding the sludge.
  
  Still, Ledo was quite worked up
  about all of the damage. It certainly is
  in dire need of repair.

  I believe he left to investigate the sludge.
  
  But I have seen no sign of him in this area
  of the domain. If you are looking for him,
  seek elsewhere.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>We are not presently graced with King

  The sludge cannot fall in here. It is safe!

  perhaps where no one has yet ventured.
  
  The road south of the domain is crumbling
  due to the Upheaval. The search team
  has surely not checked there yet.
