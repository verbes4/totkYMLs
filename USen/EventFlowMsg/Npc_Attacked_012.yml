  I couldn't make it out anymore.
  I'm worn out from straining to see it
  all night, so I'm going to take a break
  at the stable.
  You look like you've been working too
  hard. While I admire your dedication,
  be sure to rest properly.

  What a wild streak!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Could it have possibly...been a bird?
  No, impossible. Birds don't glow.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, sorry.
  
  
  I'm a bit preoccupied trying to make out
  something I saw glowing in the sky to
  the southeast. But I can't see it now.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><FontSize Value='80'/>It was glowing. I know it was. Maybe it'll come back
  out once it gets dark...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><FontSize Value='100'/>Sorry again. Lost in thought. I have a duty
  to report anything about sky islands to<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>
  Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in Necluda to the east.

  In my official capacity as a member of
  the Zonai Survey Team, I must discover
  exactly what it is!
Talk1014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It couldn't have been a bird, could it?
  Of course not...birds don't glow.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Hmm, when the weather is this bad, I just

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, sorry.
  
  
  There's something glowing in the sky in
  the southeast, and I'm determined to find
  out what it is.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It's obviously beyond the scope, or even
  the reach, of a field survey. No, my eyes
  probe the sky.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I have a duty to report anything about sky
  islands to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>our group in Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>

  I'll leave you be.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>To think that woman from earlier was with
  the Yiga Clan. Just imagine what would
  have happened if I'd gone with her!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Now that I know the truth, I won't be
  deceived so easily again.
  
  I'm reassured enough to keep
  investigating the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  the rain clears up.
