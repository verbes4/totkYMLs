  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hey there! Welcome to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Riverside Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Com_Photo_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Goddess Statues<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> stand tall
  and tranquil, quietly watching over all
  of Hyrule.
  If I could paint a picture of one of them
  for my wall, I'm sure it would keep our
  stable peaceful too.
  Apparently there's a Great Goddess
  Statue enshrined in a sacred place
  to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southwest of Hyrule Field<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But I sure can't find it.<5 Type='0'/> It might be in a
  place that's difficult to get to by horse.
Com_Photo_Thank: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, Link, with the gift of one blessed
  painting,<5 Type='0'/> you've wrapped this stable in
  a warm, cozy light.
  With this Great Goddess Statue adorning
  our walls, I'm sure the Goddess herself
  will be watching over our visitors!

  Here's a picture.

  a Great Goddess Statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you like our <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring garland <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>that much,
  then maybe you should go to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko
  Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and buy your own.
  It's near the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the east,
  so it shouldn't take you long to figure out
  your way there.
9002: |
  Goodbye.
Com_Photo_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Even a drawing would be fine. As long as
  I could just see a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Goddess Statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,<5 Type='0'/>
  I could copy it down and hang it up!
9003: |
  No pictures here...
Com_Photo_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you've got <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a picture of a Great Goddess
  Statue <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>somewhere, please show me!
Com_Photo_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's a real blessing,<5 Type='0'/> having an image of a
  Great Goddess Statue watching over us.
  Towering over us, really!
  If you'd prefer a different angle or even a
  different <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Goddess Statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I'm happy
  to copy and display a new one too.
  Simply give me the word, and show me
  the new picture!
WakkaCharm: |
  Oh, we have one of those!
Com_Photo_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Whoa...<5 Type='0'/> She is...TREMENDOUS!<5 Type='0'/> Both in
  terms of size and tranquil beauty!
  
  What a divine figure she cuts!<5 Type='0'/> It's as if my
  heart is fuller just looking at her!
Com_Photo_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Goddess Statues<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> stand tall and
  tranquil, quietly enshrined all over Hyrule.
  
  If I could paint a picture of one to watch
  over my stable, I bet it would make this
  place feel even more peaceful.
9006: |
  Replace it.
9007: |
  It's fine how it is.
Com_Photo_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>When I think that the Great Goddess
  Statue is watching over me, it makes me
  want to work a bit harder than usual!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>That's right! <5 Type='0'/>Have you already been to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>out <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>east<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  
  Kakariko Village is located between two
  steep mountains, so visitors to the village
  used to be few and far between.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>However, ever since those distinctive
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring-shaped Zonai ruins <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>landed there,<5 Type='0'/>
  things have been pretty lively!
Com_Photo_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, yes, was there something you wanted
  with the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Goddess Statue painting<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Com_FirstTime_Only01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Now then, as this is your first use of
  Riverside Stable...

  did it? Clearly you have a discerning eye!
  
  That lovely little wreath is a souvenir from
  nearby <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  The artisan apparently based it on the
  unusual ring-shaped Zonai ruins that
  landed over there.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>If you'd like one to take with you, it's only
  a short trip <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>east<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  
  There's a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>just nearby, so
  I can't imagine you'll have any trouble
  finding the place.
Com_FirstTime_Only02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Not only are we celebrating your first use
  of Riverside Stable but you've also
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>registered a horse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so...
Talk_0004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>If you're really that taken with our
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring garland<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you should get one of
  your own in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>It's right near the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview Tower <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>east of
  our stable, so I don't think you'll have any
  trouble finding it.
Com_Photo_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My mind is made up. I know just what to
  hang on that wall...<5 Type='0'/>a picture of a mystical,
  blessed, <5 Type='0'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Great Goddess Statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  Oh, and if you're not already aware,<5 Type='0'/> the
  "great" in the name refers to how BIG
  these statues are.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>They're quietly enshrined throughout
  Hyrule, but not many people know their
  exact locations...
  The closest Great Goddess Statue to us
  allegedly stands in a temple <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southwest of
  Hyrule Field<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  up empty. <5 Type='0'/>Maybe it's somewhere that's
  difficult to get to by horse...
  But I don't need to see the real thing!<5 Type='0'/>
  If I had a drawing of the Great Goddess
  Statue, I could copy it down and put it up!
