  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Will you look at that! I've never seen a
  steering stick so expertly attached.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>That's what you wanted to hear, right?
  Well, keep dreamin'!
  
  Look, if you crash, it's gonna be a

  worthy rival. You should feel honored.
  
  The time limit for the expert course is
  based on her fastest run, you know.
  
  But seeing how you're so worthy and all,
  I'm sure you'll have no trouble breaking
  her record, right?
Talk_1005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I didn't think those wheels would do much
  good out on the ocean...
  
  But Tali gets a kick out of attaching all
  kinds of stuff to her vehicle before hitting
  the water. Trial and error and whatnot.
  My only real complaint about those Zonai
  doohickeys is that they stop working if
  you use 'em for too long.
Talk_1018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you want to look the course over, talk
  to Bolson, OK?
  
  We're gonna watch your run and check
  out your technique. You know, use that
  to get a bead on things.

  set by Tali on her fastest run.
  
  You're gonna take a shot at breaking
  her record, right? Seeing how you're

  should think about getting yourself a
  bird's-eye view of the race course.
  Sure, you can run the course a bunch,
  but that'll only get you so far. Use your
  eyes. Study the course. Plan your moves.

  Plan your run ahead of time.
Talk_1009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, first things first, you're gonna need
  to build yourself a vehicle.
  
  Once you've got something you consider
  race-worthy, go ahead and attach that
  steering stick you were given to it.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Hey, hey! Don't go bothering Tali. She's
  using her racing smarts to think up some
  new vehicle designs.
  If you're looking to take a run at a course,
  you come talk to me instead.

Talk_1012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, and most importantly, the race is on
  the surface of the water.
  
  If that contraption of yours doesn't float,
  the gate won't open, and the race
  won't start.
Talk_1026: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>While I appreciate the fact you came
  running right over here to gib-gabble
