  in the battle. On behalf of all the Gerudo,
  thank you.
  I suspect the Gibdo threat will calm down
  a bit now that we've wiped out the hives
  that were surrounding the town.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>I noticed that the hives crumbled into
  sand when we destroyed them...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I wonder if the Gibdos have some kind of
  connection to the sand?
  
  Or maybe... <5 Type='0'/>Maybe they're connected to
  the sand shroud? Did they make it? Did it
  summon them?

  underdressed at the moment.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It would be better if you put on some
  more clothing before you head into
  the shelter.

  And then there's the voice that you and I
  both heard.
  
  A voice and lightning... This reminds me
  of something!

  Come down to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mural in the

  attire you are wearing is...unacceptable.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The Yiga have been our enemies for some
  time, and it would be inappropriate to
  walk around our town dressed as one.
