  usual gear here. But we're just following
  orders. It's not weird. Not weird at all.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Still, that girl who works in the stable
  took one look at all of us and left. She's
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>far over there<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...and won't come back.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>Doesn't she know we're the real deal?
  We're the Zonai Survey Team!<5 Type='1'/> This is all
  super official. It's not weird.
Talk_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're heading out now?<5 Type='0'/> That makes
  sense. Nice to get an early start.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>So, you're back again,<5 Type='0'/> traveler!
  
  
  I keep saying this...<5 Type='0'/>but yeah, we're kinda
  not wearing the usual gear, but we're just
  following orders. Not weird. No way.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Still, that girl who works in the stable took

  <3 Type='0' Data='0201'/>She's got to know, though, that we're the
  real deal! The Zonai Survey Team!<5 Type='1'/> This is
  as far from weird as it gets.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>Are you serious? I'm glad everyone back

Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Oh man...<5 Type='1'/> That girl from the stable...
  
  
  There's no way she'll talk to any of us on
  the team if we're dressed like this.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000540069007200650064005f0030003100'/>When I return to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I think
  I'll try and raise a dog too.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003100'/>Oh, it's you, traveler! Thanks to you, we
  could all dress normally again!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Then that girl from the stable came over
  to talk to some of us on the survey team.
  She knows a LOT <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>about dogs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  <4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>There aren't many girls right around my
  age in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. So, yeah, gotta say
  it was great to talk.
NakedPlayer: |
  The underpants method!
Talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're heading out now?<5 Type='0'/> Good thinking.
  A little safer these days when the sun's
  high in the sky.

  treating you?
  
  I'm still having good talks with that girl
  at the stable <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>about dogs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>There aren't many girls right around my
  age in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. So, I gotta say it's
  always great to talk.
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're heading out now?<5 Type='0'/> Well, I can't
  think of many things nicer than traveling
  by moonlight.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003100'/>Who knew I'd get so excited <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>talking
  about dogs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  No one ever seemed to talk about dogs
  at all when I lived in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

TerrorImpulse: |
  Eek!

  The girl from the stable...
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08005300690067006800'/>She'll surely return if you...<5 Type='1'/>just dress like

Near_01: |
  She came over here...
Near_02: |
  This is ridiculous.<5 Type='1'/>
0000: |
  Lurelin Village?

  Dog talk, huh?
TerrorSword: |
  Stop it!

  Goodbye.

  That's cold!

  The pirates are gone.
TerrorFlash: |
  Bwah!
TerrorArrow: |
  That's dangerous!
TerrorHorse: |
  What are you doing?!
Talk_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're heading out now?<5 Type='0'/> Well, it is
  really beautiful around here earlier in
  the evening.
  Watch where you're going though. Easy
  to look at the view and take a bad step!
Talk_22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh, yes... There's almost nothing better
  than <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>talking about dogs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to just make a
  person feel happy.
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>How did this happen? I was the last
  member of the team to reach this
  survey location.
  By then, everyone was dressed like this
  by order of Princess Zelda. Why would
  she give such a strange command?
Talk_23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>I just joined the Zonai Survey Team and
  thought I'd be investigating ruins. But
  researching monsters seems interesting.
TerrorFire: |
  None of that!

  making our research team look like fools!<5 Type='0'/>
  
  I think you DO look weird. So there,
  chew on that.

  to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> from here.
  
  It's on the sea. Everyone there makes a
  living by fishing.
  
  I can't swim. Just don't have the knack
  for it. So I didn't bother with all that
  fisherman stuff.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Being on the Zonai Survey Team is the
  life for me. So I volunteered for action,
  and action's what I got!
  But I have to say, I heard that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pirates<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  have taken over my village. That...<5 Type='1'/>worries
  me. I'm not sure if I can ever go back.

  so I started learning about them!
  
  Turns out that when dogs <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get close<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> with a
  person, they'll <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>find treasure for them<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>What's that?<5 Type='0'/> How do you get close with a
  dog? <5 Type='1'/>Well...<5 Type='1'/>love and loyalty, of course!
