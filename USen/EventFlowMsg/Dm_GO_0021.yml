  Many years ago, in the kingdom of Hyrule's
  earliest days...
Dm_GO_0021_Text_017_b: |
  A great evil, the Demon King, sought to conquer the
  kingdom and kill everyone who resisted his rule.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_018_b: |
  Rauru—the first king of Hyrule—rose up to oppose
  him, along with me and five other warriors.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_019_b: |
  And to fight the Demon King, Rauru trusted us with
  sacred items.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_020_b: |
  Secret stones... Incredible artifacts that amplified our
  powers.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_021_b: |
  I stood beside my fellow sages as the Sage of Fire,
  stronger than ever with my secret stone.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_022_b: |
  However, we were no match for the Demon King.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_023_b: |
  Even my strongest blows weren't enough to
  break him.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_026_b: |
  In one last brave act, our leader sacrificed himself to
  imprison that monster.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_027_b: |
  That was the Imprisoning War...
Dm_GO_0021_Text_035_b: |
  In that moment, the duty of the Goron people
  was clear.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_037_b: |
  I swear that, when the Demon King returns,
  the Sage of Fire will awaken again.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_038_b: |
  The Goron sage and the Goron people will fight
  alongside your swordsman.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_020_c: |
  And to fight the Demon King, Rauru trusted us with
  secret stones.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_025_c: |
  Rauru understood that we couldn't overcome the
  Demon King...
Dm_GO_0021_Text_029_c: |
  The rest of us survived, and it wasn't long after that
  climactic battle that someone came to see me. Her
  visit would set the Gorons' duty in stone.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_030_c: |
  The Sage of Time—one of the six sages.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_032_c: |
  The magic restraining the Demon King will be undone.
  He will return.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_033_c: |
  When that time comes, a noble swordsman named
  Link will oppose him.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_034_c: |
  But Link will need help. Lend him your power...
  Your fire... The Goron's mastery of fire!
Dm_GO_0021_Text_036_c: |
  I'd like nothing more than to smash the
  Demon King.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_020_d: |
  Incredible artifacts that amplified our powers.
Dm_GO_0021_Text_030_d: |
  And then, some time later...
Dm_GO_0021_Text_030_e: |
  The Sage of Time—one of the six sages—came to me.
  Her visit would set the Gorons' duty in stone.
