  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>She's a genius. Such a genius, in fact,

  She's in charge of the Depths and the

  But even so, Josha's still a kid, and
  there's no telling what dangers are
  down there.
  As such, she's not allowed into the
  Depths, so our <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai Survey Team<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  is helping with the investigation.
