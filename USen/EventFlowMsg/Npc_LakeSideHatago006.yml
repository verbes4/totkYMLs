  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This is a sanctuary for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dondons<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  the new animal species discovered
  by <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dondons <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>are quite precious, as we've only
  found five of their kind in the wild. Please
  be gentle if you touch them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>They might look intimidating, but you've
  got nothing to worry about. They're a
  good-natured sort.
  When the princess came to research
  the Dondons, they used to go tromping
  around after her wherever she went.
  I think they're actually quite fond of us
  two-legged folk.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Waaah!
Talk_0111: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh my. You've taken an interest in the
  Dondons, hm? I don't blame you.
  
  Only five of these little ones have been
  found in the world. Few have the chance
  to meet them in person.
  I promise, strange as they look, they're a
  good-natured sort. They used to follow
  the princess around like little ducklings.

  It was very sweet.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Anyway, they really are gentle. Feel free
  to come visit them whenever you find
  yourself out here.

  rumor about Princess Zelda being seen
  riding a beast?
  Well, I'd bet what people actually saw
  was her with a Dondon back when she
  established this sanctuary!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>It just goes to show how much rumors
  can take on a life of their own.<5 Type='0'/> Dondons
  aren't beastly. They're adorable.
Talk_0125: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>All this thunder and lightning...<5 Type='1'/> It's really
  fraying my nerves.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Maybe we should take shelter. Go and
  watch the Dondons while we wait out
  this storm.
Near_0001: |
  Such mysterious animals...
Talk_0126: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh! <5 Type='1'/>You startled me. I wasn't expecting
  to run into anyone in this storm.
Near_0002: |
  I've truly doted on them...
Talk_0101: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh my! You must have come quite
  a long way!

  It's still coming down.

  Oh, a ring garland. Pretty!
Talk_0102: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Still, you must have come quite a

  What do you mean?
Talk_0130: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Excuse me, but...<5 Type='1'/>you can't take that gem.

  Goodbye.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That gem is a precious clue to

  and habits.
Talk_0132: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sorry to repeat myself,<5 Type='0'/> but that gem is a
  clue to learning about the lives and habits
  of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dondons<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>W-<5 Type='0'/>wait!<5 Type='0'/> We'll get wet out here!
  
  
  If you want to talk, let's talk over there.

  a long story.
  
  One day, some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>luminous stones <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>I'd
  picked up fell out of my bag.
  
  Before I knew it, a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dondon <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>charged over,
  and then...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/><FontSize Value='125'/>Chomp, chomp!<FontSize Value='100'/>
  
  
  It gobbled the luminous stones<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>right up!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1c005100750065007300740069006f006e004e006f0072006d0061006c00'/>These animals show no interest in food...
  and then luminous stones, of all things,
  spark their hunger? <5 Type='0'/>I was shocked!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>After a while, we found <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gems<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on the
  ground where the Dondon grazed.
  
  Those...<5 Type='0'/>are the gems.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Where they came from remains a little
  uncertain,<5 Type='0'/> but I think the Dondon created
  them after eating the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>luminous stones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  If that's the case, I might learn more
  about the nature of Dondons by studying
  those. So please, don't take them.

  Down to the skivvies, hm?
Talk_0121: |

  so suddenly here. I hate it.
  
  The Dondons don't seem to mind though.

  But I'm happy to tell you about Dondons,

  But the Dondons, they don't even
  flinch at the sound of thunder.
  They're unflappable.
