  mountains with pools of freezing water.
  Be careful where you explore.
0002: |
  Where's Tulin?
0003: |
  That sounds bad.
0004: |
  Is this enough?
Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Wait... <5 Type='0'/>You didn't actually cross the pond
  and pick the chillshrooms, did you?!<5 Type='0'/><0 Type='4'/>You weren't worried about falling into
  the freezing water?<0 Type='4'/>Well, gosh. That's really brave of you.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I can't just take them for free though.
  Here, why don't I give you this?
Talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>What a disaster. I came all this way to
  scrounge mushrooms, and now this.<0 Type='4'/>I'll never get to the deep parts of the
  cave with a messed-up wing.
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003000'/>I'm getting nowhere with this. <5 Type='1'/>I guess
  I should go back for now and give the
  others the bad news.

  so I figured it'd be a prime spot for
  scavenging a little food.<0 Type='4'/>But <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cold water<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has built up in here now,
  and I can't pick any chillshrooms without
  crossing it.
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Now, how am I going to cross that pond?
Talk08_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08005300690067006800'/>There are still some caves where the cold
  water lingers. Guess we're not totally free
  from the blizzard's effects.<0 Type='4'/>You might want to be careful poking your
  own beak in any caves.
Talk02_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>Ordinarily, my wings would take me right
  over a little pond like this.

  <4 Type='0' Data='1600540061006c006b00440065006e0079005f0030003000'/>But I hurt my wing in a small scrap with
  monsters. I don't see how I can fly over
  the pond in this condition.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>I came to this cave to gather <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chillshrooms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  deep inside, but the cold water pooling in
  there means that's not happening.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you're going in there, too, careful you
  don't slip.<0 Type='4'/>Fall in that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cold water<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and your muscles
  might get too chilled to swim back out.
Talk02_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>The worst part is, I was just bragging to
  the folks in the village that I'd bring back
  even more <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chillshrooms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> than last time.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>If I don't come back with at least <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>10<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  of them, there'll be egg on my face.
Talk05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Is there anything else you need?
Near01: |
  Now how do I get food?
Talk06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Uh... <5 Type='0'/>You really don't mind giving me this
  whole heap of mushrooms?<5 Type='0'/><0 Type='4'/>Seems like you must've gone to a lot of
  trouble collecting this many.<0 Type='4'/>But if you're sure, then thanks a bunch!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I can't just take them for free though.
  Here, why don't I give you this?
Talk07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You looking for Tulin?<0 Type='4'/>He's out at another <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> gathering food
  with Gesane and them.<0 Type='4'/>There's a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bonfire<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> marking the entrance.
  You'll find it eventually if you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>go west
  down the mountain slope<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a0055006e006400650072007300740061006e0064005f0030003100'/>If you start freezing on your way there,
  take a minute by the fire to warm up.

  scrap with some monsters, I could have
  crossed that pool in a few short flaps.
Talk04_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>How am I going to face the other villagers

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08005300690067006800'/>Feels like every cave I check has pools of
  cold water building up now. <5 Type='0'/>Probably
  another effect of the blizzard.<0 Type='4'/>You might want to be careful poking your
  own beak in there, you know.
