  I want to give you a shield, but you've got
  to make some space in there first!

  What a nuisance...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>The tumbleweeds really are a nuisance...
  
  
  If I sweep them away, they come right
  back. I don't have any idea what I can
  do to clean it all up.<5 Type='1'/>

  gone, I can handle cleaning up the rest
  of this by myself. Leave it to me!

  Hard not to be upset at the sight.
  
  I spotted it during my travels, and the
  sight bothered me so much, I couldn't
  help stopping to clean it up.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I believe that we travelers have a duty to
  protect the beauty of nature and not sully
  it with trash!<5 Type='1'/>
  Yep. When I leave a place, I want it to be
  cleaner than when I arrived.
  
  That's why I even travel with a broom,
  as you can see.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Unfortunately, these tumbleweeds keep
  rolling in. There's just no end to it.
  I can't keep up!<5 Type='1'/>
  I do want to leave this place cleaner
  than when I arrived, so I can't just
  overlook all of this.<5 Type='1'/>
  I think I could make progress here
  if only these tumbleweeds didn't
  keep tumbling in...<5 Type='1'/>
Step1_Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>The tumbleweeds kept rolling up and
  rolling up... I got tired trying to stay on
  top of all of them.<5 Type='1'/>
  I could try again tomorrow.<5 Type='1'/> But I want to
  sweep away some of them, at least...
  
  *sigh* <5 Type='1'/>I just wish there was a way to
  get rid of them all...<5 Type='1'/>

  to give you before.
  
  Can you believe I found this while
  I was cleaning?
Step1_Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If I could clean up all the tumbleweeds,
  then I could clean up everything else,
  piece by piece.<5 Type='1'/>
  I'm going to need to work at it until it's
  all done, no matter what.<5 Type='1'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh! Did you clean them all up?
  
  
  There were so many. Wasn't that a lot of
  work? Thank you so much.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Please, take this. It's something special
  I found while I was cleaning.

  I believe that we travelers have a duty

  For me, that means leaving a place
  cleaner than when I arrived.
  
  That's why I even travel with a broom,
  as you can see.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But in all my travels, I've never had
  someone do my cleaning for me!
