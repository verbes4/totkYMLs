  today? <5 Type='0'/>Everyone relies on my cooking to
  get them through the day, after all...

  important for me to cook the perfect
  meals for everyone.

  tomorrow, I wonder?
  
  Breakfast helps everyone wake up in the
  morning, so it needs to be good...

  think... Are you here because you've
  heard about me?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Well, it's all trueâ€”I'm the one in charge of
  keeping the members of the researching
  team healthy and happy.
  And I've figured out the secret to keeping
  them energized. Want to know what it is?
Talk_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ha, of course you do! <5 Type='0'/>And I'll tell you!
  
  
  It's all about what they eat!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>When it's hot outside, you should cook up
  meals using chillshrooms. When it's cold,
  substitute sunshrooms instead!
  It's amazing how well the body can hold
  up to high or low temperatures if you've
  used the right ingredients.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Well, want to try it for yourself? I'm sure
  you do! Feel free to use this pot.
AssassinEquipment_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I have to say...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Dressing like that to scare me isn't very
  nice. You should put effort into thinking of
  others if you want to be a good cook.

  off right, after all...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='100053006c006500650070005f0030003000'/>So sleepy...
Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Be careful if you head to Gerudo Canyon.
  It's not a welcoming environment and will
  almost certainly tax your endurance.
  If you ask me, the best way to prepare is
  to bring plenty of good food with you!
Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Have you forgotten the secret I shared

  researchers here healthy and energized.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Oh!<5 Type='0'/> Are you interested after all?
  
  
  Do you want me to share the secret to
  keeping everyone energized?
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>For you to wake me up out of a deep,
  restful sleep... Do you miss my cooking so
  much that you can't wait until morning?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Sleep is as important as eating well, you
  know. Everyone needs to sleep away the
  fatigue of the day before.
  How about we chat in the morning.<5 Type='1'/>
  Good night...
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>It's important to get a good night's rest.<5 Type='1'/>

  such nice things about my cooking?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Well, I do my absolute best to pick the
  perfect ingredients for each meal. It
  makes sense they would love the results!
  Thanks for sharing that with me.
