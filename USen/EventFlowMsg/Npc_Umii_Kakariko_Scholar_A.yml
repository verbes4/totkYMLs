  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Well, ahem, if I'm honest, even an expert
  like me doesn't know EXACTLY what
  gloom really is.
  The Depthsâ€”you know the Depths, don't
  you? The vast, dark expanse that these
  chasms lead to?
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>Anyway, one can find gloom all over the
  Depths. It emerges from these chasms to
  taint the surface.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Just<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> touching it will steal your vitality<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so
  watch out. Dreadful stuff.
  
  *sigh* Unfortunately, that's about as far
  as my research has taken me.
