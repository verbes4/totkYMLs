  The Stone Slab at the Southern Ring Ruin:
  Some Translation Notes
  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 -Tauro<0 Type='4'/>"Who protect...of Hyrule from the Demon
  King together... King...<0 Type='4'/>"There were...known as sages..."<0 Type='4'/>What I take from this is that it's about a
  facet of Hyrule as it was in those days.<0 Type='4'/>If I were to guess at how to fill in the
  gaps, it'd go something like...<0 Type='4'/>"There were those known as sages,
  who protected the kingdom of Hyrule
  from the Demon King."
