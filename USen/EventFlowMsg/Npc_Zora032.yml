  As captain of the Zora's Domain guard,

  I do not want to know what that was all
  about, but as far as I am concerned,
  nothing beats a nice, savory fish.

  Such is my duty as captain.
  I shall ensure that any and all travelers

  We are truly lucky that you were here

  However, we must be prepared to respond
  to the most dangerous of dangers and the
  worst-case scenarios on our own!

  He was chewing a crab whole as he
  spoke. It made me think...perhaps he
  ought to retire soon.

  Aside from you, Link, our first visitor was
