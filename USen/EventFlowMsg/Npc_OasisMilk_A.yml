  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I heard someone say "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Aaqlet<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>" when I was
  standing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>by the shelf<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the canteen down
  in the shelter.
  It must have been the voe in the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>jail<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> talking...
talk0009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Now that you mention it...
  
  
  I do remember something from when
  Perda came back to town with little
  Aaqlet in tow.
  Didn't the guards mention they'd seen a
  voe wandering about outside of town
  around then?
near0000: |
  Ugh. This thing...
near0002: |
  The voe in jail...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Yes, I'm sure of it! And it came from over

talk0021: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So that voe they threw in jail really must
  be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Perda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s husband, right?
  
  But if that is the case...
  
  
  Perda wouldn't even know! After all, she's
  working at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Secret Club<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>she's not in the shelter<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Ugh...<5 Type='1'/> I don't even want to think about

  I heard it<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> down in the canteen<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the

  the shelf<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  He must be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Perda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s husband after all.
talk0036: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003000'/>What about that Hylian voe who helped
  clear up the sand shroud?
  
  He seemed OK...
talk0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>All this talk just makes me think I should
  find a voe for myself too.
talk0037: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>Yeah. I think he'd make an acceptable
  partner, at least.
  
  He is certainly strong. There's no doubt
  about that.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Wait, is this about what you heard?
talk0012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I've been wondering if maybe it's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Perda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s
  husband locked up in there...
talk0038: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>I agree. He's definitely OK at least.
  
  
  Huh.<5 Type='0'/> Maybe he'd be worth a second look
  the next time he comes to town?
talk0000: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So you know the voe that's been locked

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Yup. I heard it coming from<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> behind

  I'm almost certain it was a voice

  <4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Ooh, I like this idea! If one of us found our
