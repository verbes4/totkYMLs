  will not be done. There may be geoglyphs
  located all over the world.
  We must brace for a long, arduous search.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The ancient literature indicates the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten Temple <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is here in Hebra—at
  the bottom of the canyon.
  Within that temple, Link, we believe we
  can find the key to unlocking the mystery
  of the geoglyphs.

  A geoglyph here too...

  Cado and I came here to see a geoglyph.
  Sadly, we were thwarted by the blizzard
  and grounded nearby.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>After it finally calmed down, we made our
  way to this village.
  
  We plan to get on with finding that
  geoglyph shortly.
