  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh yeah, also! Some of the Koroks could
  use your help.
  
  You should probably talk to the Great
  Deku Tree first, but then maybe you
  can help out...
Talk1010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>And I've got a favor to ask! Some of the
  Koroks could use your help...
Talk1011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Follow the lights in the forest...
TerrorArrow: |
  That's not nice!
Talk1012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you do, you'll come across different
  Koroks who could use your help. Please
  go find them, and see what they need!
TerrorFire: |
  I don't wanna burn!
Talk1013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You...<5 Type='1'/> This is perfect! I've got a favor
  to ask.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Some of the Koroks have had stuff on
  their minds lately.
Talk1001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c00570061006b00650075007000'/>*yaaawn*<5 Type='1'/> My head's still all fuzzy...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh! You're... Hang on. What are you
  doing here?
0000: |
  The Great Deku Tree?
Talk1014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You should go talk to the Koroks who
  need help!
TerrorInsect: |
  Shoo! I don't have honey!
Talk1002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh, oh, yeah! Now I remember! It all
  happened so suddenly.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The Great Deku Tree was in agony, and
  ominous fog came out of his mouth...
  
  And THEN! A bunch of us Koroks started
  acting funny.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Next thing I knew, monsters showed up,
  and I fought them all by myself, knocking
  them out one by one by one!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Um... Sorry.<5 Type='1'/> I lied. I actually couldn't
  move and don't even remember
  what happened.
  It was all so sudden... I don't know if any
  of the others remember either.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But thanks to you, Mr. Hero, everybody is
  back to normal! Yay!
  
  I'm sure the Great Deku Tree wants to
  say thank you too! You should go!
0001: |
  We already met.
Talk1015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The Koroks are happy as can be.
  Hmmm, I'm guessing<5 Type='2'/> it's because
  of you? Thank you!
TerrorImpulse: |
  Hey!
Talk1003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>As everyone knows, the Great Deku Tree
  is the spirit of Korok Forest!
  
  If you climb up the root behind me, you
  can talk with him.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You're the one who saved the Great Deku
  Tree's life, so please go say hello!
Talk1004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>Oh, you already met up?
  
  
  The Great Deku Tree has been alive much
  longer than us Koroks, so he's kinda stoic
  and doesn't always show his feelings.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But I'm sure that he's thankful and happy
  for what you did! And so am I!
TerrorBomb: |
  You're scaring me!
TerrorExplosion: |
  So violent!
Near1001: |
  ...
TerrorGeneric: |
  Hey!
Talk1006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Because of you,<5 Type='0'/> Korok Forest has
  returned to being peaceful again.
  Thank you!
  Oh, have you met with the Great Deku
  Tree yet? If you still haven't, well then,
  you should!
Near1002: |
  *yawn*
TerrorIce: |
  So c-c-cold!
Enokida: |
  From Tarrey Town?
Near1003: |
  They need help...

  Eeek!
