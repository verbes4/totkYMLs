  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, I don't think I've seen you around
  here before. Good on you for saying hello.
  
  Who are we? We're the first men who will
  officially do business with the Gerudo—
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Voe Caravan Squad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  If you, too, want to go to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  you would do well to make friends
  with us!
talk0032: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>*ahem* Anyway, the Gerudo have a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>law
  forbidding males<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> from entering their town.
  
  Keeping us shut out only makes us
  all the more curious though! I mean,
  that's just common sense!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>We were hoping to raise the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Voe Caravan
  Squad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s likability by gallantly rescuing the
  Gerudo ladies from the sand shroud...
  But the sand shroud doesn't just block
  our vision, it confuses our compasses too.
  We got lost in about five seconds.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>In the end, it was the Gerudo ladies who
  ended up gallantly rescuing us...
  
  Still, maybe if we prove our muster as
  gate guards, Gerudo Town will make an
  exception and welcome us as heroes!
talk0033: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Don't tell me, young man!
  
  
  You want to join us—the first men who will
  officially do business with the Gerudo—
  in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Voe Caravan Squad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  Well, too bad. United for years by our
  love of Gerudo Town, our squad has
  been together through thick and thin!
  So when those gates finally open, it'll be
  just the three of us striding together into
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
talk0023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We're a group of merchants and friends
  who have long dreamed of doing business
  in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, and "voe" is the Gerudo word for
  "man." Voe's the word to know!
  
  If you don't understand at least one word
  in their language, the Gerudo will never
  accept you!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>And we should know! We've spent years
  here trying to curry favor with them any
  way we could.
  They've finally entrusted us with
  protecting the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>western entrance<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to
  Kara Kara Bazaar!
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I've lost count of the number of times I've been

  Voe Caravan Squad?
talk0024: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's only a matter of time until we become
  the first men invited into Gerudo Town,
  I'm sure of it!
talk0034: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That's right, captain! This is nothing
  compared to the time those travelers
  thought we were a band of criminals!
  Or when we were captured and nearly
  skewered by the guards!
  
  Or when we finagled our way into
  Gerudo Town and got thrown in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>jail<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
0008: |
  Goodbye.
talk0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Young man! As the captain of the caravan
  squad, allow me to thank you once again
  for rescuing Ponthos!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>However...
talk0025: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Just when we were getting on their good
  side, we messed up our one job. They'll
  never trust us with guard duty again!
  For anyone else, this would spell disaster
  for a plan to officially do business with
  the Gerudo...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But the Voe Caravan Squad doesn't know
  the meaning of "give up"!

  truly indomitable.
  
  Though now that you've brought up all
  those traumatic memories, I'm feeling a
  bit more...domitable than I was earlier.

  Gerudo Town?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Now that the sand shroud cleared up,
  I think we'll head to Gerudo Town to

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Once this sand shroud clears up, I think

  I got sand in my eye!
talk0028: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We were fired from guard duty for
  whatever reason...
  
  Which puts a damper on the Voe Caravan
  Squad's plans to become the first men
  officially accepted by the Gerudo.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But we don't have it in us to give up now!
talk0029: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Gerudo Town is located straight out of
  this gate. It's a town made by Gerudo, for
  Gerudo... Which means it's full of Gerudo!
  And to us...
