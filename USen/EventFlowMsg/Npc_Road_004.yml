  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>I'm feeling experimental. I think I'll try to

  Rumors say there's an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>unknown creature<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  kicking around. I hear that and I wonder,
  how is it going to taste on rice?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>I can't believe I wanted to cook those
  poor, sweet creatures lovingly raised by
  the princess herself.
  The only thing I deserve to eat is a big,
  flaky slice of humble pie with a side of
  shame soup.<0 Type='4'/>...You better not speak one word of this to
  the princess! Got it?

  It's risky to go unarmored.

  The meat is crucial.

  As for what kinds, hm... There's talk lately

  A traveler from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>south <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>told me about it.
  Is it an animal? A monster? I couldn't
  tell you. All I know is, I want to find out
  how that thing tastes!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>You mean the rumors are true? <5 Type='1'/>Princess

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I was going to cook an animal the princess
  loved in the recipe she taught me.
  How horrifying.<0 Type='4'/>All along, the real animal <5 Type='0'/>was me.
  I'm the one who deserves to be cooked

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>...Don't tell anyone about this! <5 Type='1'/>Got it?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you want to add some freaky flavors to
  your cooking, I suggest sprinkling in some
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster extract<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  You can buy it from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tarrey Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. That's
  in the Akkala region in the northeastern
