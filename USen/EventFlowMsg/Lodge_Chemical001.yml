  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>You kiddin' me? The power of love is no
  match for this kinda cold!
  
  At this rate, we're gonna freeze to death
  before we get to meet the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>legendary
  shield surfer<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Come on, can't you catch us a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>summerwing butterfly<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> so we can
  make a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>spicy elixir<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?

  nice 'n' proper like.

  <FontSize Value='125'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thanks for helping us!<FontSize Value='100'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>We took a break in this here vacant house
  to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get away from the cold<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and before we
  knew it, monsters had us surrounded.
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I still can't believe you came to help us.
  You really did save us, you know.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Ever since <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, there've been
  more and more monsters. We were trying
  to be careful, but...
Talk_42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Ah, hold on! You're lugging around too
  much stuff already, aren't ya?<0 Type='4'/>I was going to give you a spicy elixir
  as a little thank-you gift.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But I'll wait until you've cleared out some
  room for it.
0000: |
  No. What is it?
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I don't know how to thank you enough,
  but please, take this...
Talk_43: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I was planning to give you a spicy elixir as
  a little thank-you gift for saving us...
  
  But it looks like you're already carrying
  as much as you can carry. So, lemme
  know when you lighten your load, OK?
  Oh, uh...or did you want to ask me
  something about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield surfing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
0001: |
  Yes, I'm familiar with it.
Talk_44: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Looks like you've finally got some room
  to carry stuff.<0 Type='4'/>So here ya go...<5 Type='0'/> Just a little gift to say
  thanks for saving us!
Talk_27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Ah, that's right...
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Maybe someone's come to help.
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Ah, but it doesn't feel like it's thanks
  enough. Not for someone who saved
  our lives...
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Of course you are! You hauled yourself to
  a place covered in snow, so you gotta
  know a thing or two about shield surfing!
  Anyhoo, just remember, after you get the
  shield into position, all ya gotta do is
  jump on it and ride.
  But of course, there'll be no surfin' for
  you if you don't <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get some momentum<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  goin'. It's kinda tricky like that, eh?
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Shield surfing is a way of gettin' around
  by ridin' and slidin' on a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  First you hold up a shield, then you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>jump<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  on it and ride!
  
  But you gotta <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get some momentum going<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  or it won't work. It can be kinda tricky
  like that.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>I may not look like it, but I used to be a
  professional shield surfer, ya know.
  
  I heard a rumor there was this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>legendary
  surfer<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> somewhere in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hebra Mountains<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  so I came here lookin' for 'em.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But, well, I didn't know their exact
  location. Worse yet, I took a break here
  and ended up surrounded by monsters.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hey, but if you need to know anything
  about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield surfing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, at least I can help
  with that.
  Anything you don't understand about it,
  just go ahead and ask me!
Talk_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, hey, I got an idea! <5 Type='0'/>Mister, do you

  hear <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monsters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> out there, don't you?!
  
  You took too long gettin' ready, and
  now we're surrounded again!
Talk_32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I-I said I'm sorry...<0 Type='4'/>You know, we really should have brought
  a weapon with us, not just a shield.
Talk_16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you like that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> over yonder, go
  right ahead and use it. We brought plenty
  of our own.
