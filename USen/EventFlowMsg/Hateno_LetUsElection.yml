  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Cece, wait.
Talk1057: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0901'/>You can't fool me, Cece. You've loved
  simple, plain things forever, including
  the vegetables of Hateno Village!
Talk1028: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>No, Reede. It is I who should be ashamed.
  My childish pride would not allow me to
  admit the truth.
Talk1058: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0901'/>I know for a fact that you hide in the silo
  at night to snack on vegetables!
Talk1029: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Cece... <5 Type='0'/>I can't deny any of it.
Talk1001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Everything's ready! It's time to get the
  election for village mayor started!
Talk1059: |

  Everyone's gathering in the plaza!
Talk1061: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>The trends and style I made my name on

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>People of Hateno!
Talk1004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And now, without further ado, let's have
  each of our candidates for mayor say a
  few words!
Talk1062: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'd be a fool to pretend you're not the
  reason our village is flourishing. I don't
  want to deny you your due.
Talk1033: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sophie and Clavia told me what you did
  on our behalf.<0 Type='4'/>Thanks to you, Hateno Village is thriving
  once more.<0 Type='4'/>We ought to reward such fine work, hmm?
  Come to Ventest Clothing when you have
  a moment.

Talk1063: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We've come to a decision!<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The best way to keep Hateno Village
  vibrant is to work together to combine
  traditional culture with new ideas!

  to hold it.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This is your reward for a very noble effort!
  I can't let you leave empty-handed.<0 Type='4'/>Ditch something unfashionable, and come
  back to me when you're ready.

  look absolutely dashing on you.
Talk1066: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My plan is to strengthen our community
  with new local specialties, starting with
  our brand-new Hateno cheese!
Talk1037: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Nonsense! It's trends that shape the
  world, not the other way around.

  It's almost time!
Talk1067: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Vegetables don't make the world go

Talk1069: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>As for myself... <5 Type='1'/>I've had a long think about
  where to take my brand from here.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>To begin with, I'll study my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>collection of
  unique goods<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> designed by our forebears.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>See me if you happen to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>part ways with
  precious apparel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that's too rare to be
  purchased.<0 Type='4'/>I might have something in my collection
  that can serve as a guide!
Talk1012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Fashion comes and goes! Your style is
  trendy now, but it'll be over soon, and
  then where will we be?!
Talk1041: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm sorry too.
Talk1042: |
