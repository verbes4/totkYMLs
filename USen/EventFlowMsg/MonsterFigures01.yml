  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>But they're also misunderstood!<5 Type='0'/> The way
  everyone hates them without even trying
  to understand them... Pitiful! Tragic!
  And so I will educate the world
  about monsters...
  
  And once the world understands
  monsters, they will love monsters.
  That is my dream!
  But for my plan to succeed, I require
  the assistance of the finest carpenter in
  all the land... Hudson!

  Without further ado, this adorable,
  cuddle-able monster is called a
  Bokoblin.
  They make house and home throughout
  Hyrule and are, perhaps, the monster
  you've rubbed shoulder bones with most.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>With their large, fwoopy ears and cute,
  gloofy snouties, one can't help but want
  to give them a tight squeeze.
  Sadly, their social skills are quite...
  stunted...and it's best to look elsewhere
  for a friendly embrace.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What I'm trying to say is...
  
  
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Bokoblin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s most distinguishing feature
  is its nose, which you'll find squished
  upon its face like...GLOOF!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Its ears, on the other hand, are quite
  FWOOPY, and its horn goes ZWIIIFF!
