  "Seek out the swordswoman upon the

  there is treasure waiting underground."
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>There are countless swordswomen statues
  in this desert. The only option might be to
  see where each one directs you...

  Ack!

  affiliated with the ancient Gerudo...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>I knew you'd be able to find it. <5 Type='0'/>Take it
  with you, and make good use of it.
TerrorBomb_01: |
  What is that...

  treasure the old document mentioned?
TerrorBomb_02: |
  Stop!

  That's the treasure mentioned in that

  Hey! Stop that!
TerrorFlash_01: |
  Aaah...

  I imagine that once you've found the fifth

  Demon King...
  I'll be prepared for when that battle
  comes. You can count on me!
ThunderHelmet: |
  That helm...
TerrorIce_01: |
  Phew, I'm cooling off...
TerrorLightning_02: |
  Lightning? Against me?
GerudoDesertTreasure_Near_00: |
  Now that I think about it...
TerrorIce_02: |
  I'm not used to that...
GerudoDesertTreasure_Near_01: |
  Where she points...
GerudoDesertTreasure_Near_02: |
  Is that...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Interesting. So she's an ancient Zonai

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>And even though she's lost her original

  Her name was...Mineru?
GerudoDesertTreasure_Talk_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>After I became a sage and returned
  to town, I discovered an interesting
  ancient reference...
  "Seek out the swordswoman upon the
  sand and look to where she points—
  there is treasure waiting underground."
  That was written in an old document
  I discovered.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I doubt it holds any connection to Zelda,
  but it might be a clue to something...
  
  The swordswoman upon the sand...<5 Type='0'/>
  Treasure underground...<5 Type='0'/> It could be worth
  looking into.
