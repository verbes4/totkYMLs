Talk36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you! Thank you!
  
  
  Seeing the Frox right here, like this...
  I'm happy beyond happy.
  
  Here's a gift for all that you've done.
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>M-may we borrow it?
Talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>We went to all that trouble to get the
  sculpture made.
  
  I want nothing more than to give it the
  many looking eyeballs it deserves.

  with the things I gave you before.
  
  And this is for you too, as usual.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You've helped make my dream come true.
  To build a collection of monsters from
  around the world...to share them with all! 
  To show people that monsters are
  people toooo!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you! Thank you!
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Just leave it to me. I'll have it made

  Oh, look at me. My legs are all wabobbly
  with excitement. Vivid, so vivid! This is
  a Frox!
  And made so tastefully. It's just as perfect
  as I dreamed it would be!
Talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I wouldn't mind trying my hand at another

  Goodbye.

Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Yes! Now let's put it before every face
  in the village.
Talk44: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>In that case, I'd looove for you to

Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!
  
  
  This is the rarely sighted Frox!
  
  
  But do not fear, draw near! This is the
  only place you can safely admire such
  a monster up close. The only place!
Talk45: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Truth be told, when it comes to the Frox,
  I've only heard secondhand stories.
  
  But I'm told its body is knoblobbity
  with bumps and lumps, and quite
  GABAAANTIC in size.
  Its gaping mouth goes NUMMAMMUM,
  and it's got biiig tusks too!
  
  And finally, it's said the Frox lives deep
  down in the vast dark places.
Talk32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Goodness me! Who knew monsters got
  that big?

  An enormous monster...

  about it as many times as you like!
Talk33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>*ahem* This sight has stolen your eyes.
  Now, give me your ears! All of them!
  
  Once again, this monster with the
  foreboding look is called a Frox.
  
  Gobbles up all it sees! And sees all that
  it wants to gobble!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh, but if it saw you! You'd be INTO its
  mouth and DOWN its gullet in no time
  at all.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>And yet...<5 Type='1'/>the ore on its back twinkles
  and sparkles in the dark depths of the
  earth. It must be quite mesmerizing...
  I'd love put my eyeballs upon it just once.
  But no, I don't suggest you try it. It could
  be the last thing your eyeballs ever see.
