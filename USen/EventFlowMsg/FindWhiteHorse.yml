Talk_0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Truth be told, he's missing. Ran away just
  before the stable was built.
  
  Well, he's always been a meek horse,

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gentle beige <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>coat and you'd know it
  was him.
  Course, you'd recognize his unique <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gray

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003100'/>A horse like him, I bet you he's someplace

  But he deserves a freer life than I can give
  him. It's time for me to let him go.
Talk_0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>He ran off on me just before the stables

  I call him Spot because of his unique
