  At the very least, I must strive very hard

  The repair is mostly complete, but it does

  I need a fish called an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ancient arowana<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I can finish the armor right away if I can

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>If you locate one, Sir Link, please bring it
