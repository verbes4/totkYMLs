  So that's the time you need to beat.
  
  Touch <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>all the lights<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and then get back
  here faster than that, and you win.
  
  But you can't <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>take your hands off<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  the steering stick or <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>go too far off
  course<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, OK?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>So how about it?<5 Type='0'/> You want to make a run

  versus Tali?<5 Type='0'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>She used to be called the Dame of the
