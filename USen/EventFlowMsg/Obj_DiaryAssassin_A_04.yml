  Though our time with the Thunder Helm
  was brief, we did manage to complete a
  thorough analysis of it.
  Finding lightning-resistant materials was
  no small feat, but I suppose that makes
  sense for the Gerudo's sacred heirloom.
  Even with the metals and gems on hand,
  however, we still cannot seem to replicate
  the techniques used to craft it.

  I've been struck by lightning more times
  than I can count. I've felt my soul flicker
  on the boundary between life and death...
  Just as my body neared its limits, one of
  our intelligence officers shared some
  promising news.
  While disguised as a traveler, he hit it
  off with a fledgling tailor and learned
  about a special stitching technique.
  We applied that technique to our own
  helm, and for the first time, it repelled
  lightning.
  Our Lightning Helm was born.

  Just as the Gerudo's sacred heirloom was
  said to be selective about its users, so
  too is our Lightning Helm.
  Our inconsistent results were not merely
  technological, but contingent on the
  helm's compatibility with its user.
  Though I had hoped to train someone to
  wear the helm, the many electric shocks
  I've suffered have taken their toll.
  My body is at its end, and my chance to
  name a successor is long past.
  
  Though I could make only one, I leave this
  world dreaming of the day that a member
  of our clan dons the Lightning Helm...
  and at long last brings the royal family of
  Hyrule to ruin.

  The Thunder Helm has been passed
  down from one Gerudo chief to the
  next for generations.
  Though we were briefly able to steal this
  electric shock-repelling helm, it was
  quickly retaken.
  We had mistaken their chief's youth for
  naivet√© and paid the price for it in turn.
  Makeela Riju is not to be taken lightly.
