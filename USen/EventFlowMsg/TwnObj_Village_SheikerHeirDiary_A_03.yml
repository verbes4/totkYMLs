  The Zonai Survey Team has arrived at
  our village.
  
  Their leader, Tauro, is truly incredible
  and has already found a clue in the
  quest to decipher the Zonai writing.
  I tentatively named the ruins that fell
  upon our village the Ring Ruins.
  It seemed the obvious choice.
  The villagers have treated me with such
  warmth. They even embraced my decision
  for us to coexist with the Ring Ruins.
  Of their own volition, some of our villagers
  volunteered to aid research, and others
  for patrol duty. It is humbling to behold.
  Dorian's sweet little daughter, Koko,
  even crafted souvenir items called
  ring garlands.
  Before I knew it, our days of never having
  visitors had passed. Our quiet village
  seems to have regained its vigor.

  Before all else, we must learn more about
  the Ring Ruins. It is my responsibility as
  chief to see that it is done.
  I intend to fulfill my duties as chief in a
  manner that is slightly different from
  my grandmother's way.
  Gone is the chief who sits in her hall with
  quiet wisdom. That is what the village
  needed of her then, but no longer.
  I must keep moving forward so that,
  when she returns, I can greet my dear
  grandmother with a triumphant smile.

  One day, Grandmother said to me,
  "You've grown up, Paya." It took me
  by surprise, so I simply nodded.
  She nodded back and said, "It's settled.
  As of today, you are the chief." And so it
  was. Suddenly, I was the chief.
  But...what can I hope to achieve?
  
  
  Just like Grandmother, I do have Dorian
  as my aide, for which I'm grateful. Yet,
  for some reason, he seems troubled.
  Grandmother has become obsessed with
  old books. I'm hesitant to reach out to
  her with my concerns.
  I fear this chief's hat that Grandmother
  has given me is too heavy for me to bear.
  Literally... It rather hurts my head.

  It happened suddenly. Without warning.
  
  
  I was so frightened by the impact. It was
  as though someone had taken hold of this
  world and given it a violent shake.
  The air grew stagnant, weapons decayed,
  and ruins fell from a somber sky shrouded
  in dark clouds.
  How fortunate that none of the villagers
  were injured. As for the village itself,
  it has been utterly transformed.

  Five large, ring-shaped ruins fell down
  upon the village, and a large opening in
  the ground has been spotted at East Hill.
  Even with everything that is happening,
  Grandmother said that she was going to
  set out on a journey with Cado.
  I tried to stop her from going at a time
  like this, but she insisted that such times
  are precisely why she must go.
  I had no choice but to bid her farewell.
  Her eyes seemed to wordlessly say that
  she was shouldering some great mission.
  There were 11 peculiar symbols depicted
  in the books Grandmother was reading.
  
  Could they somehow be related to her
  sudden departure?

  I told Purah of Lookout Landing about our
  village's situation. She said ring-shaped
  ruins are incredibly unusual.
  Realizing this could be a good opportunity
  to help the village, I made arrangements
  with the Zonai Survey Team at once.
  I returned home to greet them, and that's
  when Princess Zelda arrived at the village.
  
  She seemed almost like a doll of herself...
  the same outside, but no spirit within.
  I could not hide my uncertainty.
  She forbade anyone from entering the
  broken and partially floating ruin.
  And then she left. Just like that.
  She did not mention the village's awful
  condition or have any words of kindness
  for our villagers.
