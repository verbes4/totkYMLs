  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Seems like that clothing item can't be
  enhanced. How about another piece
  of clothing?
ComTalk_026: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>That clothing item can't be enhanced with

  their powers back into the world...
ComTalk_027: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>If you want me to enhance that clothing
  item,<5 Type='0'/> I will need the help of my sisters...
ComTalk_010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Any other clothing items you want me to
  work on?
ComTalk_028: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Don't be unreasonable. Though, if my
  sisters were awakened, it might be a
  different story...
ComTalk_051: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>There we go. Splendid quality, if I do say
  so myself.
ComTalk_011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I can't enhance your clothing,<5 Type='0'/>
  but let me tell you why...
ComTalk_029: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You... Please go help my sisters.
  Doing so will allow me to enhance
  that piece of clothing.
ComTalk_052: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Very good, very good. Yes, this is
  fine work.
ComTalk_012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Oh! You don't have any clothes at all?
  Well, if you get some, come back and
  I'll see if I can enhance them for you.
ComTalk_053: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It turned out quite well. As is natural for
  my blessing.

  Here, <5 Type='0'/>let's take a look. Maybe I can
  see what's stopping me from helping.
ComTalk_054: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Truly flawless work. Take it, and
  be grateful.
ComTalk_015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>With the power available to me...<5 Type='0'/>
  I can enhance your clothing
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a fair amount<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well...<5 Type='1'/> A slim little lad like you is fine, too,
  I suppose.
Talk_1008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I moved here to be near a stable, or near

  Can you enhance this?
ComTalk_002: |
