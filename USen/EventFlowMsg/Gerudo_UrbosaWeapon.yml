  Here, take them. They are a true symbol

  Give me just a minute...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's very important that the materials not
  have any extra things attached to them.
  
  I'm not trying to be difficult—this is just
  the reality of the situation.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Oh, and if you're worried about losing
  whatever is attached...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You should head to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tarrey Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in

  I hear there's an expert there who has

  They may be able to help you out.

  My ancestor even made them for the

  Should they ever be irretrievably lost,

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>And...also...
  
  
  You can come and see me whenever you

  OK then, I just need you to gather some

  Truth be told, I'd like to gather the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>Now, would you allow me to make them
