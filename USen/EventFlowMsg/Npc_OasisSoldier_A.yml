  tell us to pay attention to our own shortcomings!

  the Gibdos.
  
  She's the one who told us that our spears wouldn't
  even leave a mark though...<FontSize Value='100'/>
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Up till now, I've been training extra hard
  with the spear with Babi, but...
  
  Maybe it's time we formed a bow-and-
  arrow unit.
  
  Once I've finished up polishing this spear,
  I think I'll let Babi know that I want to
  change directions.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><FontSize Value='80'/>Yup, just gotta finish with this spear, then I'll be
  ready... Maybe.<FontSize Value='100'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>The real fighting is gonna start soon, but
  I'm still sore from Babi's scolding and
  from all the extra training after that.
  She knows that regular spear attacks
  won't do anything against the Gibdos.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>We shouldn't be lax about our training,
  of course, but I want her to acknowledge
  that there's more to a successful battle.
  You know, things like <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>gathering intel and
  learning an enemy's weaknesses<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...

Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>You could be right...
  
  
  Still, it's amazing—and a bit wild—that
  Babi is training so intensely.
  
  I mean, spear attacks didn't even slow
  those Gibdo things down.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Your coordination with Lady Riju was
  impressive! Not bad for a Hylian voe.
  
  There aren't that many Gerudo who use
  a bow and arrow, so you really were
