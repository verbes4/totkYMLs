  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey there, partner. <5 Type='1'/>What's up?<5 Type='1'/> Feeling a
  little lonely this evening, are you?
NakedPlayer_01: |
  Causing a scene, huh...
Talk_0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I see you're still awake, partner. <5 Type='1'/>Most
  folks are sound asleep at this hour.<5 Type='0'/>
  What's up?
NakedPlayer_02: |
  News flash! This kid's odd.
Talk_0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Oh, hello, partner. <5 Type='1'/>What's going on?<5 Type='0'/>
  Starting your day feeling a little lonely?
Near_0001: |
  Which stable first...
Talk_0016: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hello there, partner. <5 Type='1'/>This rain is really
  something, isn't it.<5 Type='1'/> Anyway, what's up?
0000: |
  It was thanks to you!
Near_0002: |
  Not a clue in sight...
Talk_0017: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh, hey, partner! I didn't think I'd be
  running into you here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Did you hear how well the articles
  investigating the rumors of Princess Zelda
  did? Apparently folks really enjoyed them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>To think we were able to reveal the truth
  behind those stories...
0001: |
  It was thanks to me!
Near_0003: |
  Someday...
0002: |
  We make a great team!
Near_0004: |
  So they finally did it...
Talk_0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>OK, listen up, partner! We're on the trail
  of the truth about Princess Zelda.
  
  We can't let even the smallest clue
  slip through our talons. Or hands, in
  your case.
  We should visit as many stables as we
  can. Travelers always have plenty of
  goings-on to talk about.
Talk_0019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Right, well... Maybe it's not my place to
  say, but I think we made a great team.
  Our first time working together too!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>That's the right way to look at it anyway.
  But I'll also say...<0 Type='4'/>On any given story, whoever did the
  earliest talking with sources probably
  gets the most credit for wrapping it up.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So, which of us was the most helpful
  one here?
Talk_0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='140047006f006f0064006200790065005f0030003000'/><FontSize Value='125'/>Soar long!<FontSize Value='100'/>
Talk_0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Without you, I wouldn't have gotten all
  the facts for our stories. Hard to look at
  myself in the mirror, realizing that.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It'll be good for me to relax in this place.
  A famous bard perfected his craft here,
  studying the songs of this land.
  Besides, our editor, Traysi...<5 Type='0'/> She told me
  to take some time off.
Talk_0021: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Yeah, you're not wrong about that.
  You gave it so much effort that it really
  put the wind under our wings.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>You really did.<5 Type='0'/><0 Type='4'/>Then again,<5 Type='0'/> how far could you have
  gotten without the chirps and warbles
  I got from my sources?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So maybe I deserve a fair share of the
  credit here...
Talk_0005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So...I'll leave that froggy armor with
  you for now.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  ...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>What, you think it wouldn't fit me?
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Don't you worry! I could squeeze into
  that anytime.
Talk_0023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>Hahaha! You think so too, partner?
  
  
  My zeal for the truth behind a story is
  what got us to the answers, that's
  for sure!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Heh, aw... Who are we kidding?
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>We both know that you were the one who
  did most of the heavy lifting, partner!
Talk_0024: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>True enough. You're not wrong.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But how far could you have gotten if I
  didn't share the chirps and warbles from
  my sources? Worth a thought.
Talk_0025: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Nice of you to keep saying that. But look,
  you need to see it from this angle...
  
  On any given story, whoever got the
  first questions in with our sources maybe
  gets the most credit for where we got.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So, which of us was the most
  essential here?
Talk_0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'll stay right here and look out across the
  land, just like that bard. I'll get in touch
  with my reporting instincts!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a00440065007400650072006d0069006e006100740069006f006e00'/>Then you bet I'll get my talons on a huge
  scoop that will knock you flat on your
  tail feathers, partner. You just wait!
Enokida_00: |
  You're an original, all right.
Talk_0026: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, look at this. You're the one I saw
  flying around the sky.
  
  It's great to meet the first one to ever
  be launched from a Skyview Tower.
  A real historic moment.
  Hey, what's your name?
Talk_0009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>A famous bard once perfected his craft in
  this place, studying the songs of this land.
  
  I'll stay right here, just like him, and look
  out across the land. I'll get in touch with
  my reporting instincts!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1a00440065007400650072006d0069006e006100740069006f006e00'/>You know that I'll be back in action
  someday, partner. One half of a great
  team—just wait and see!
Enokida_01: |
  News flash! This kid's odd.
Talk_0027: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Link, you say?<5 Type='1'/> Hold on there...<5 Type='0'/> Really,
  your name is Link?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Hey, buddy...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>You've got the same name as that
  famous swordsman.<5 Type='1'/> Ha, good for you!<5 Type='1'/>
  Pretty big name to live up to though.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Penn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, by the way. I work for the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lucky Clover Gazette<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  I'm writing an article about this event,
  so folks everywhere will know about the
  Skyview Towers being activated!
  I'd better get to work. Our newspaper is
  short on staff, so I've had to flap all over
  the place to cover the news.
  Hey, we could use another reporter!
  You should join us. Seem like a brave
  type and all—that's what it takes.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Our newspaper is based in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hebra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the
  northwest. You'll find it near the bridge
  that leads to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rito Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Stop by if you're up for the adventure of
  a lifetime...<5 Type='0'/>in the newspaper biz!
  
  Until then...
Enokida_02: |
  Going undercover or what?
Talk_0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Mmm. I thought there'd be at least some
  clue, but there's nothing...
  
  Hmm?
Talk_0028: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Mmm. It looks like there's nothing for
  us here...
  
  Hmm?
Talk_0029: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You're really missing our time together,
  aren't you?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Those articles investigating the rumors of
  Princess Zelda did well, didn't they.
  Apparently folks really enjoyed them.
  It makes sense to me though! We made a
  pretty perfect team.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>We revealed the truth behind a lot of
  rumors, partner.
Talk_0012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hello there, partner. <5 Type='1'/>What's up?<5 Type='1'/>
  Everyone else is really busy, leaving you
  feeling a little lonely?
NakedPlayer_00: |
  Fairly plucky of you there...
