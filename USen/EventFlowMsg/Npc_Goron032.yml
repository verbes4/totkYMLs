  makes me want to go there again.
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Sure, sure. There are other hot springs
  boiling away in other places, but the hot
  water here is the best.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Simmerstone Springs is in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>caves<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gorko Tunnel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, which is southeast of
  these springs here.
  They're top secret, ya see.<5 Type='0'/> Ya gotta be
  a Goron in the know to know about 'em. 
  
  The water at those springs is the perfect
  temperature and goes real nice with all
  the steam in the caves.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But the entrance got blocked off so...
  
  
  I can't ask YunoboCo to fix it, and I can't
  clear it out myself.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>But this spring here is my favorite right
  now, so I guess I don't need any others.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>Well, no matter where it's located,
  a hot spring is a hot spring. It all feels
  the same.
  This one here is pretty nice though. After
  all, you can look at the Death Mountain
  scenery while ya soak.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>This hot spring does happen to be a good 
  one. After all, you can take a soak while
  gazing at the Death Mountain scenery.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Up until a little while ago, red smoke and
  big ol' clumps of red rocks were flying
  right out of it.
  I was worried it might erupt again.<5 Type='0'/> But it
  seems to have calmed down now.
  
  Talk about a relief.
