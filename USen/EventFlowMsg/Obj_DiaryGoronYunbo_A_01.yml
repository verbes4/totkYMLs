  After the eruption at Death Mountain
  stopped, the lava stopped flowing all
  over Eldin.
  Then it got colder. The sudden shift in
  climate has made folks feel sick.
  
  And whoever isn't sick is upset by how
  different everything is round here.
  
  At this rate, Goron City will fall apart.
  I keep wondering if there's anything I
  can do.

  The lava has cooled and hardened, which
  means we can reach areas we weren't
  able to before.
  Eldin is covered in rock now, and there's
  ore galore! There's only one thing to
  do now.
  Dig and dig until there's no more digging
  to be done. We'll dig up every bit of ore
  and get the city back to booming!

  I was busy digging in the caves and
  mining ore, and before I knew it,
  everyone was helping out.
  Slergo and Offrak were the most
  ambitious of the group.
  
  I thought I was the only one who cared
  enough to get the city back to booming,
  but I was wrong!
  I figured it's a good time to offer job
  security to everyone by starting up
  a company.
  We're calling it YunoboCo. Slergo and
  Offrak came up with the name.

  It's still pretty chilly around here these
  days, but most of us have gotten used
  to it.
  With the temperatures cooler, now
  anyone can visit Goron City without
  using fire-proof gear!
  We're going to build a new road so to
  make it more welcoming to travelers.
  
  With more travelers passing through, we
  can offer the ore mined up by YunoboCo
  for a special price!

  Something called the Upheaval happened,
  and Hyrule Castle is floating in the air!
  
  Princess Zelda and Link have gone
  missing, and Purah has sent out search
  parties. I'd like to go lend a hand...
  But lately there has been strange red
  haze coming from Death Mountain.
  
  Before I leave, I'll go see what's going
  on to make sure everyone in the city and
  my workers at YunoboCo are safe.
