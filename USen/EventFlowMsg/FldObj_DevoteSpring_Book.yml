  Legend has it that the Zonai hid a
  treasure in this cave long ago. The
  clue is as follows.
  "Throw the Zonai spear with a wing
  from the pedestal, through the ring.<0 Type='4'/>"Should your aim be true and right,
  you'll be blessed with dispelling light."<0 Type='4'/>I have thrown the spear countless times
  in pursuit of this legend, but never once
  managed to get it through the ring.
  My spirits blunted, I have given up. I leave
  a record of this clue in the hopes that
  whoever tries next will have better luck.
