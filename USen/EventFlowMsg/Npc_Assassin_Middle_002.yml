  he did!
  
  He may have caught us off guard last
  time, but he's in for a nasty surprise if
  he tries it again!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The spikes are all in place.
  
  
  But do we really need all this? It's not

  Good. Link let the tailor who made our

  They probably even know about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Great

  we're on the lookout for Link!
  
  That guy's trouble, and he's got a bad

  expect him. We can never be too careful!

  on top of your blademasterly duties?
  Your dedication is admirable.
  Then I have just the task for you. Link let
