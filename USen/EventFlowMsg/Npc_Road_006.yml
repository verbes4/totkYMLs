  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>All right, big guy.
Talk1011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The weather's a little overcast right now,
  so they're hard to see. But it should clear
  up sooner or later.
Talk1012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We used to be solo travelers too, until
  we ran into each other on the road.<0 Type='4'/>The big lump's got no sense of direction
  at all. Would you believe he forgot the
  way to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, his hometown?
  I couldn't bear to watch him flail around,
  so now we're travel buddies.
Talk1013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>I didn't forget the way! The way changed!
  How was I s'posed to know the lava would
  cool like that?<0 Type='4'/>It used to be scorching hot, crisscrossing
  the mountain...

  buddies. We make up for each other's
  weaknesses.
Talk1015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sorry for nattering on. The sight of
  you traveling alone just made me a
  bit nostalgic.<0 Type='4'/>We're thinking of going to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>

  This guy's dying to see the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

Talk_20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>I told you! You're not permitted!

  Give up! Go back where you came from!

  Using <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Death Mountain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> as a landmark is all
  well and good, of course.
  
  But the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>red haze <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>around the summit looks

  Try not to get too close.

  I'm so busy with them, I've had no time

  But I'm fine. Who I worry about is Merina.
  She can't stand voe, and these ones are

  If she gets any madder, it'll turn into a
