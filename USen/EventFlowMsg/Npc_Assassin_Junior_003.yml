  eavesdropping?!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Could you get lost already?! This is a
  two-person conversation, so stop trying to
  listen in! Seriously, what's your...<5 Type='1'/>deal...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Wait. <5 Type='1'/>That nobleness to your bearing...
  Could it be? Are you that Yiga who just
  became a blademaster?!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Even compared to the others, this branch
  is REALLY well hidden. <5 Type='1'/>And Link still
  found us and messed things up!
Talk_001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Does the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lightning Helm<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> really work?
  
  
  I mean, it's metal, right? How's lightning
  supposed to bounce off of it? I figured the
  research team was playing a joke on me!

  tailors free.
  
  But no matter. We will rebuild. Remember,
  these branches exist to advance Master
  Kohga's control over the Depths.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Besides, it's better he raid our branches
  than attack our hideout and try to take
  our <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lightning Helm<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_008_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Er, excuse me. I'm nervous enough talking
  to one blademaster, let alone two. I beg
  you, please, stop listening in for a while.<5 Type='1'/>
Talk_003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeesh, can you imagine a zap-proof Link?
  What a nightmare.
Talk_008_3: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Er, excuse me. That helm's so...<5 Type='0'/>dauntingly
  impressive, it's kind of hard to chat in
  front of you...<5 Type='0'/>
Talk_004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Don't worry. Even if Link makes it to the
  hideout, there's an army of our best guys
  waiting for him. He won't stand a chance.
Talk_005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's no joke. The helm is a very special
  piece of equipment. From what I hear, you
  don't choose to wear it, it chooses you.
Talk_006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm sorry, hold that thought for a second.
Talk_007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>What do you want? A Yiga's supposed to
  eavesdrop on enemy conversations. It's
  just plain rude to do it to your allies!
