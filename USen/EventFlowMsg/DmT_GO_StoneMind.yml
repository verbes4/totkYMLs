  You defeated that monster—the source of those foul
  rocks. But it was the Demon King who summoned it.
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_012_b: |
  Let me tell you about the Imprisoning War and the
  duty of our people.
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_000_b: |
  Yunobo, little rock...
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_007_b: |
  He sent that monster to keep you from obtaining the
  stone you just found—my secret stone.
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_001_b: |
  I've heard that voice...
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_008_b: |
  Secret stone? Demon King?
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_002_b: |
  Are you the one who's been talking to us this whole
  time, goro?
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_009_b: |
  Hah, so this is the first you've heard of any of this...
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_003_c: |
  Yes. I am your ancestor from a time long past.
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_004_b: |
  I served the first king of Hyrule as a mighty warrior
  and as a sage who, like you, could command fire.
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_005_b: |
  You fight using your body as a weapon... Impressive!
  You ARE my descendant—the pride of the Gorons.
DmT_GO_StoneMind_Text_010_c: |
  Then listen carefully to what I have to say.
