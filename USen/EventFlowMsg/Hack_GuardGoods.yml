  How'd you fight monsters so high up?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>Eh, who cares? What matters is you did it!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>But against a swarm, there wasn't much
  I could do but set a signal fire and wait for
  help to arrive.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>Sadly, unless you have a pair of wings
  I'm not seeing, I doubt you can reach the
