  were worried about us?
  
  I admit, we've been hurting ever since
  Link freed the tailor who was making
  our uniforms.
  But at least he was so focused on the
  tailor that he didn't manage to steal
  anything on his way out.

  And they call this moron a hero? Ha!

  after leaving it alone for so long?
  
  We've taken over this place. It's now the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Yiga Clan's Akkala Branch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  other hideouts are completely untouched.
  What a moron!
  And besides, these branches are just
  footholds for Master Kohga's domination
  of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Our enemies can attack them all they
  want—his ambitions will not falter!

  Those might be useful, so send them to
  the hideout's research team right away.
Talk_203: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>How "right away" are we talking, here?
  
  
  I mean, we're in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Akkala<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—northeast
  Hyrule—and the hideout is all the way
  southwest in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo region<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Since it's on the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>completely opposite<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> side
  of the map, I get the feeling that might
  take a while...
Talk_205: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Stow the complaints!
  
  
  The role of the branches is to provide
  intel and supplies to the hideout's
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>labs <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and our <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bases in the Depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  Anything we think is useful goes to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hideout<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>! That's the ironclad rule!

  you must be our newest blademaster.
  
  I've heard all sorts of stories about you.
  Have you come to support this branch?
  
  Your help is appreciated. Link set our
  tailor free, so things have been hectic.
  I admit, we let down our guard there.
  <4 Type='0' Data='10004c006100750067006800420061006400'/>We're just lucky Link is such a moron!

  He's just as cowardly as the rumors say!
