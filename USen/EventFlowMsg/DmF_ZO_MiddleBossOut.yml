  Ahem, in any case, it is possible that
  another monster will appear. I suggest
  that you return to the domain at once.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>All this time he was clinging to regret over
  being unable to save his precious sister,
  Mipha... My poor, tormented Sidon.
  And to think he was unknowingly
  paralyzed from taking action because
  he feared losing me as well...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Yet he has overcome this trial and placed

  However, more importantly, we must
  consider what Sir Link spoke of earlier.
  The pillar of light that he said appeared
  at the reservoir begs to be investigated.
  
  This may be our opportunity to learn the
  cause of the sludge falling from the sky
  or even Princess Zelda's whereabouts.
