  as a swarm of Gibdos.
  
  If we want to hit all three of them with one
  strike, you should aim for the space
  between themâ€”like where that rock is!
  I could also quickly hit each one
  individually. That would work too.
  
  Regardless, the farther my target is from
  me, the longer it takes to build up the
  energy to strike them. <5 Type='0'/>Keep that in mind.
