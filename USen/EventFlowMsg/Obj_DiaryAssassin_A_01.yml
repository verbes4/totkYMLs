  We've now taken over the Sheikah lab,
  and filled out the map with the locations
  of our hideout and branches.
  The lab is located near a local stable. It's
  also not far from Tarrey Town, which was
  impacted by falling Zonai ruins and parts.
  Suffice it to say, I think both of these
  locations will be suitable for procuring
  supplies and intel.
  Though we haven't yet received any word
  of Zelda, there have been many reported
  sightings of her swordsman, Link.
  His days are numbered, though, as the
  surface division is setting up a network
  of their terrifying banana traps.
  I'm embarrassed to say I've fallen for one
  myself... Tempting though it may be, try
  not to pick any bananas up off the road.
