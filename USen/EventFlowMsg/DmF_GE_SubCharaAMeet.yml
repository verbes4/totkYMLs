  ago. We sent out patrols to try to
  determine what was causing it, but...
  A swarm of monsters—creatures called
  Gibdos—suddenly appeared, attacked our
  troops, and forced us to retreat.
  The Gibdos have even made their way into
  the town. As a result, everyone was
  evacuated to this shelter for their safety.
  As someone charged with protecting
  Gerudo Town, I am ashamed at our
  current situation.
