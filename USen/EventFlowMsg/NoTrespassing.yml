  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But...<5 Type='1'/>when I tried to go back to it,
  there were a bunch of monsters
  coming out of the woodwork.
  Tree monsters and bone monsters. So
  I'm keeping guard here to warn other
  Koroks, because it's real dangerous.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But I'm not about to stop any Hylians who
  are feeling brave. <5 Type='0'/>Just be careful.
  
  Oh, and the flowers are there to help
  keep you from getting lost. So don't go
  picking them!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Oh, you're a Hylian. Well, since you're not
  a Korok, I guess I don't need to stop you.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>There's this thing beyond here that I can't
  stop thinking about... I keep wanting to go
  check it out again.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You know<5 Type='0'/> the thing that showed up in
  Korok Forest?<5 Type='0'/> I saw something similar
  to that, but it looked kinda different...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There's lots of monsters past here, so be
  careful if you continue on.
  
  Oh, and the flowers are there to help
