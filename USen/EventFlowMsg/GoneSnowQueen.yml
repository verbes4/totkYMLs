  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Maybe,<5 Type='0'/> just maybe,<5 Type='0'/> the problem is she
  can't move, or maybe she's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>somewhere
  she can't see the smoke signal<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>I see, all right... <5 Type='0'/>So ya heard about
  Selmie going missing from Russ. Yeah,
  I still have no idea where Teach is. 
Talk03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Maybe you're not here for advanced
  study, then... OK, here's the basic idea
  behind shield surfing...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Take your favorite shield and turn
  it into a way to slide down snowy
  mountains with grace!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I left the pro side of shield surfing behind
  to help the next generation step up, using
  this lodge as a teaching center.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>But shield surfing in this weather is
  nearly impossible to do safely.<5 Type='0'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>So I've put off teaching my students
  until the blizzard stops.
Talk06_00: |
  Guess that's all you want to know.
Talk52_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'm sendin' up a smoke signal. Hopefully
  Selmie or my best buddy Russ sees it.
  He's back at her lodge on Hebra Peak.
  You'd think that if Selmie was here, she
  would have seen the smoke by now.
  But nope, nothing.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Maybe she's here but can't move?<5 Type='0'/> Or
  maybe...<5 Type='0'/>she's stuck in a place <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>where she
  can't see the smoke signal<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Talk04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Heh. I knew you'd be interested.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>But sorry. I have two students.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If I take a third, I'd worry they wouldn't
  get as much training as they deserve.
  So, I can't take you on right now.
Talk52: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Just recently, Selmie said she was
  going to build a new course for us to
  really push our shield-surfing skills.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>She set off for that slope. But then...
  she disappeared.<5 Type='0'/> Me and my buddy
  haven't been able to find her.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='1c005100750065007300740069006f006e004e006f0072006d0061006c00'/>Right, goodbye. But keep in mind
  that it's dangerous around here in
  the blizzard.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Feel free to get some rest in the lodge
  before you set off.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Be sure to return to show me your skills,
  just after this blizzard ends.
Talk53: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>That terrible blizzard stopped, so I took
  advantage of the weather to go out and
  create a new course for my students.
  And then I found this cave—just surfed
  right into it on my shield. Can't blame an
  ol' shield surfer for exploring, right?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I went in too far though, where the cave
  got all closed off. I couldn't climb back
  out the way I came in.
  Worse yet, I heard rocks falling back up
  at the entrance. Thought it'd collapse
  at some point.
  I was staaarting to think I'd be stuck
  back here forever, and no one would
  even be able to find the cave.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>It's dangerous around here in the
  blizzard. Feel free to rest in the lodge
  before you head out.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>And return here to show me your
  shield-surfing skills after this blizzard
  finally ends.

  shield surfing?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/>Or maybe<5 Type='0'/> to ask Selmie if she'd take
  you on as a student, like us?
Talk08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Then you're one of us! Or, uh, I wish.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Be great to have ya, but Selmie is
  stoppin' at two students right now.
Talk09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah, she said she wants to give us two
  her focus. She's not gonna add any more
  students for now.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hard to complain 'bout that though.
  She's one dedicated teacher to give us
  all her attention.
Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>I bet once we prove that we've learned
  enough, she'll take more students.
  
  But this blizzard...<5 Type='1'/> We can't train in this
  weather, so we can't learn our way to
  mastering what's she's got to teach!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I'd say just get off the mountain for
  now.<5 Type='0'/> Wait for this snow...<5 Type='0'/>to cut out all
  this snowin'.
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Come back when the blizzard's over,
  maaan. Then we can get down to some
  shield surfing—rad times all around.
  Maybe by then, the two of us will be good
  enough to prove we've learned lots from
  Selmie...<5 Type='0'/>so she'll teach you too.
Talk23_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>It's been a while since I sent up the
  smoke signal.<5 Type='1'/> I wonder if I should set
  out lookin' for her again.
