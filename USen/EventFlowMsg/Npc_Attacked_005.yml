  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, sure! Maybe stick around and listen
  to a song or two though? <5 Type='0'/>Really helps to
  calm the prebattle jitters.
Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>At my level, you can tell how strong a
  weapon is by just looking at it.
  
  And that Lynel weapon you showed me?<5 Type='0'/> 
  That was the strongest I've seen in all my
  days of looking at weapons!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>It's inspired me to get out there, fight a
  big monster, and harvest its parts to use
  in my own smithing.
  Won't be easy. But if I train enough,
  I'm sure I can do it!
Near02: |
  Rain again, huh?
Talk11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Question is, what kind of monster should
  I go for?<0 Type='4'/>A Lynel, like you? Maybe a Hinox?<5 Type='0'/>
  Or what about a Talus?<5 Type='1'/>
0005: |
  A Lynel.
Near03: |
  Gotta be prepared.
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you were me, what would you go for?<5 Type='0'/>
  A Lynel, a Hinox,<5 Type='0'/> or a Talus?
0006: |
  A Hinox.
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>You've got to pretty fearless to take on
  a Lynel.
  
  One was spotted northwest of here <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>near
  the entrance to Tempest Gulch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Though knowing you, I guess that one
  might've been defeated already.
  
  Lynels are swift, they're strong...<5 Type='0'/>and
  they can fling fireballs from a distance.
  Not easily beaten.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But if I could <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get on its back <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and ride it
  like a horse, maybe I'd have a shot.
0007: |
  A Talus.
Talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>To get the materials for a strong weapon,
  I'll have to fight one of the biggies.
Talk14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>But a Hinox... <5 Type='1'/>That one's really for the
  stout of heart!
  
  I actually did hear about one at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rist
  Peninsula <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to the south of here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Hinox though... <5 Type='1'/>They're huge and can
  deal loads of damage.
  
  Strong attacks wouldn't be enough.
  I'd have to fortify my defense as well.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Doable, I think... But I'll need to get some
  better armor and stock up on food.
0008: |
  Goodbye.
Talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>A Talus though... <5 Type='1'/>Fighting one of those
  takes real guts!
  
  I did hear a rumor that there's one in
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>North Akkala Foothill<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the northwest
  of here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But those things are solid as boulders...<5 Type='0'/>
  I doubt my current weapon would even
  make one flinch.
  If I want to fight a Talus, I'll have to invest
  in a hammer that can smash rocks.
Talk21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Off to fight monsters that come out
  at night? How very you!
Talk16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Right! I'd better train.<5 Type='0'/> Have to be ready if
  I want to beat one of those monsters.
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Any other monster you think I ought
  to consider? 
Talk18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='22005100750065007300740069006f006e004e006f0072006d0061006c005f0030003100'/>Didn't you already say that one?<5 Type='0'/>
  Well, that's OK.
Talk19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, hello again.
  
  
  I'm hoping to make a weapon as strong as
  the one you showed me.
  
  But to do that, I'll have to fight a big
  monster...and that means preparing
  myself for a tough battle.
