  Sefaro is the son of Sayge from the dye
  shop. He's a bit of a firebrand, but also
  one of my brightest students.<0 Type='4'/>After class, he always selects a book to
  read quietly by himself.<0 Type='4'/>He already reads at an adult level and
  doesn't shy away from difficult subjects,
  such as the Calamity.<0 Type='4'/>The family business has been booming
  ever since Cece came to town, which may
  make it hard for him to study at home.<0 Type='4'/>Sayge has an artisan's spirit and would
  rather have his son helping out at the
  store than going to school.<0 Type='4'/>But everyone learns differently. I want our
  school to be a place where children can
  get an education no matter their needs.

  I understand you'll be heading soon to
  Hyrule Castle to investigate the reports
  of strange phenomena there.<0 Type='4'/>I trust you'll be fine with Link at your side.
  Nevertheless, I can't shake this strange
  tightness in my chest.<0 Type='4'/>It's similar to what I felt right before the
  Calamity, come to think of it.<0 Type='4'/>The children know you as Ms. Zelda,
  their beloved teacher and mentor.<0 Type='4'/>But I know that Princess Zelda's duties
  are wider-ranging than that. Take care,
  Princess, and return to us soon.

  Karin is the only daughter of the mayor
  and his wife. She's kind-hearted but shy,
  and seems to lack self-confidence.<0 Type='4'/>She's very perceptive though. She has a
  way of seeing right to the core of things.<0 Type='4'/>I'm sure you know, Princess, that Mayor
  Reede has been breeding vegetables to
  appeal to the younger generation.<0 Type='4'/>It was Karin who first noticed that her
  peers were losing interest in produce.<0 Type='4'/>She figured this out based on nothing but
  the number of customers and total items
  in stock at the general store.<0 Type='4'/>I see her one day becoming a scholar to
  rival Purah. Possibly even surpassing her!

  Aster is one of Medda's children. She's a
  very active girl.<0 Type='4'/>I believe we have Medda to thank for that
  charming bob cut she sports.<0 Type='4'/>She loves her father and always wants to
  talk about his comings and goings.<0 Type='4'/>Lately, she's been especially focused on
  the Hylian tomatoes Medda is growing.<0 Type='4'/>For a time, she seemed out of sorts after
  Ms. Cece bought their house next to the
  clothing shop.<0 Type='4'/>But she was back to her usual bright self
  soon enough, noting that her new home is
  cute, colorful, and "close to froggy."<0 Type='4'/>She has a real knack for finding the silver
  lining in every situation!

  Azu is the brother of Ivee from the 
  general store. But he'll tell you his true
  identity is A-Zoom, the "big-time hero"!<0 Type='4'/>He and Sefaro used to be inseparable.<0 Type='4'/>But ever since the dye shop started
  getting more clients, A-Zoom has been
  left to patrol after school alone.<0 Type='4'/>Although his mother is Amira, one of the
  town gossips, he keeps a close eye of his
  own on the goings-on within the village.<0 Type='4'/>It may seem like simple child's play, but
  people really do straighten up when they
  know they're being watched.<0 Type='4'/>As long as he's on patrol, I think we have
  nothing to fear in Hateno Village from any
  would-be evildoers.
