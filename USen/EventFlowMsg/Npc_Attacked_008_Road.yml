  Is she OK by herself? Is she finding new
  mushroom types?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>We've never split up like this.
  
  
  But...she's got a good head on her
  shoulders.<5 Type='0'/> Just, um, don't tell her I
  said that.
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>She's probably doing just fine selling the
  mushrooms she finds.

  caves again...
  
  Some mushrooms only grow in caves,
  and Satori Mountain isn't far from here.

  Whenever I see one, it's hard to keep my
  feet on the ground.

  Mushrooms make me think about
  Meghyn, and Meghyn makes me think
  about mushrooms.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Mushrooms aren't sticky, usually...but
  they're what holds us together.
Near_StartPoint_01: |
  Mushrooms... Hmm...
StartPoint_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>See all these trees? Mushrooms like to
  grow in places like this.
  
  You'll also find fruits and herbs and
  things, but who cares about that when
  there are all these perfect mushrooms?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>All this traveling is giving me lots of
  new ideas.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  Like, what if there are mushrooms on
  the sky islands? Ones that don't grow
  anywhere else?
  If I was a Rito, I'd explore every island.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Isn't the forest incredible? It provides all
  sorts of things, from fruit to herbs...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  But I barely think about that when there
  are mushrooms to find!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>When I spend too long on the ground, I
  start itching to go climbing for rushrooms.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>It's not only the rushrooms I want—it's
  also the thrill of climbing a cliff to
  pick them.

  Even on cliffs...
Near_GoRange_01: |
  Caves are good spots...
BackRange_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I know there aren't SUPPOSED to be any
  mushrooms in the fields, but what if
  there ARE?
  Wouldn't it be awful if I overlooked one
  just because I didn't think it could exist?
Near_BackRange_02: |
  They're in the grass too...

  When I see a mushroom...

  places, so exploring caves is inevitable.
  
  I haven't been to Satori Mountain yet,
  so that sounds like a good place to
  head next.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>Mushrooms like trees, not big empty
  stretches of grass. Looking in fields
  might be useless...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But what if I miss one? <5 Type='0'/>I'd never
  forgive myself.
Near_RestPoint_01: |
  On that sky island...

  Meghyn's also off looking for mushrooms

  Thunder?!

  mushrooms she's found on her travels.

  Um, y'know, Nat. I'm usually with my little

  mushroom haven!

  and the mushrooms!
  
  It's because of you that the mushroom-
  haven mystery is solved!
  
  Meghyn and I are traveling separately
  for now. We're each trying to discover
  new mushrooms.
  There's no way I'm going to let her find
  some before I do. What kind of big sister
  would I be if I let her beat me to it?

  My little sister, Meghyn, and I split up to
  see if we can discover new types of
  mushrooms. Can you help me out?
  Just kidding! I want to know I beat her all
  by myself.
