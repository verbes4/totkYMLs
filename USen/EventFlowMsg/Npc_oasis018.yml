  and ending up in the strangest place...
  
  Everything looks the same down here.
  It would be so easy to get turned around.
  
  I wonder if the people who originally made
  this place got lost in it all the time too.

  was teaching a cooking class here.
  
  You see, you can get really far in life—and
  in love—if you have a solid grasp of the
  essentials of cooking.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>But she has so many students now that
  her other class, "Voe and You," takes up
  all her time.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004300680061007400'/>So she's opened this place up for
  everyone's use.
  
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cookbooks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> here are really useful too.
  If you're planning to do any cooking at all,
  you should definitely give them a read.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh... You're that voe that everyone has

  If I were younger, I might have been

  Disappointed that I wasn't shocked and

  Anyway, I'm going to go. I'm feeling
