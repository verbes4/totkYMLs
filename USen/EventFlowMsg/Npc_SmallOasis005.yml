  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Um, uh... You do know the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  makes compasses stop working, right?
  
  You're not really thinking about trying to
  push your way through it...<5 Type='1'/>are you?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>H-hey... I'm sure you know, but out in the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, even the fanciest compasses
  will just stop working.
  So if you're thinking about trying to brute
  force your way through it...don't!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh* Now that we've got Ponthos back,
  I just want to hurry up and get out of
  here. Doesn't matter where we go next...
  Everything was fine until we were given
  guard duty. We just had to be the first to
  flee when the monsters appeared...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>The soldier ladies' stares are so cold...
  
  
  Ugh... I want to find a hole to hide in...
talk0019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh* Why did we run away like cowards?
  No, I guess anyone would run away from
  an attack like that...
  Ugh. I still want to find a hole to hide in.

  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Speaking of, Ponthos said he fell into a hole when he
  ran through the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>... Maybe I should throw
  caution to the wind and jump into a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sinkhole<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> too...<FontSize Value='100'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It took years and years of regular visits,
  but we've finally started to convince the
  Gerudo that they can depend on us.
  So please, I'm begging you, don't ruin it
  by causing any trouble or being reckless.
