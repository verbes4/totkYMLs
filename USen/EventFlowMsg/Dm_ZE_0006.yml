Dm_ZE_0006_Text_028_b: |
  But there is still more to those tales...
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_023_b: |
  "To swallow a secret stone is to become an
  immortal dragon...
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_036_b: |
  I'm sure Sonia would be happy to help you.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_019_b: |
  That means...if you don't already know how to get
  yourself home...
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_031_b: |
  I thought maybe this could lead to a solutionâ€”some
  way to transcend time...
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_001_b: |
  This is...definitely not from this era.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_006_c: |
  So you really believe my story? That I came from
  the future?
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_014_b: |
  As for you, I can sense both...light and time powers.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_036_d: |
  
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_014_d: |
  
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_026_b: |
  So you think these stories could hint at a solution to
  our dilemma?
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_034_b: |
  Ah... Back where we started.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_009_c: |
  I suspect it was the power of your secret stone that
  allowed you to travel through time.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_017_b: |
  Ultimately...the secret stone only amplifies
  your power.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_004_c: |
  Yes! Whatever you need. I really appreciate your help.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_012_b: |
  Rauru can repel or destroy evil with his power
  of light.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_029_b: |
  "To become an immortal dragon is to lose oneself."
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_024_b: |
  "one blessed with eternal life."
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_034_cb: |
  
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_007_b: |
  I never doubted you for a moment.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_032_b: |
  But if you have to sacrifice your heart and mind...
  Sacrifice what makes you "you"...
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_015_b: |
  But your secret stone seems to amplify your
  time power.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_024_d: |
  
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_002_c: |
  That said, I believe there may be a way to get the
  travel functionality working here.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_010_b: |
  To put it simply, secret stones amplify the power
  their owners possess.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_027_b: |
  Yes.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_035_b: |
  There's still hope! I think the answer... The answer to
  this problem lies in study and learning more about the
  nature of your power.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_005_b: |
  Then I'll hold on to it.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_018_b: |
  It doesn't suddenly grant you mastery and control.
  That's still up to you.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_022_c: |
  There are stories about the secret stones and a
  forbidden act called draconification.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_000_b: |
  It is quite an interesting device...
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_013_b: |
  And Sonia, she can control time.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_030_c: |
  That is why it is forbidden.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_038_b: |
  OK!
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_025_c: |
  Interesting. Another way to reach the future...though
  not a very quick one.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_033_b: |
  I'm sorry. I wish I could help more.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_003_b: |
  I'd like to tinker with it a bit. Would it be OK if
  I borrow it?
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_008_c: |
  Mineru, do you know of a way we could help to return
  Zelda back to her time?
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_020_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_033_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_011_b: |
  I am able to separate my spirit from my body.
Dm_ZE_0006_Text_016_c: |
  Time power...
