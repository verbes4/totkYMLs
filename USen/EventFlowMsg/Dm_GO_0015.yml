  The gate you must pass through is firmly
  locked with five padlocks.
Dm_GO_0015_Text_003_b: |
  You have the power to unlock them all.
  Do so, then the gate should open.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>No denyin'. I heard it loud and clear this
  time. But who could it be?
  
  And what did they mean by "young,
  little rock"?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>They did tell us how to open the gate, so
  they can't be all bad, right?
Dm_GO_0015_Text_005_b: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>So all we gotta do is unlock the five locks,
  and then we can get in there?
