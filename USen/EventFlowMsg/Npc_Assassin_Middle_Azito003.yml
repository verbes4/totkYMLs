  I'd heard talk of a potential new member.
  I take it that's you.
  
  I can hardly believe how quickly you
  managed to visit all three branches...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003000'/>Impressive, <5 Type='1'/>to say the least.
  
  
  This hideout is the linchpin of the Yiga
  Clan's subterranean expansion.
  
  It's where we train our members, develop
  our special vehicles, and do whatever else
  needs doing.
  That's it for the explanation. You'll figure
  things out if you keep your eyes open.

  place, let alone rise to blademaster.<5 Type='1'/>

  But don't let your title bloat your ego.
  Stay faithful to the cause with a sharp
  blade and a silent heart.
  I imagine you're well acquainted by now,
  but this hideout is the linchpin of the Yiga
  Clan's subterranean expansion.
  It's where we train our members, develop
  our special vehicles, and do whatever else
  needs doing.
  I hope you'll find this place can serve you
  as well as you can serve it. We're grateful
  to have you, blademaster.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That fearless demeanor...<5 Type='1'/> You must be the
  one they're all talking about. The new
  recruit who became a blademaster.
  Our nemesis, Link, has been foiling our
  plans, so it's heartening to have a
  powerful new warrior among our ranks.
  With you as its cornerstone, this hideout
  is going to be invincible! Let's see Link
  try getting in here now!

  I take it you're worried that Master Kohga
  is gone?<5 Type='1'/>
  Hmph. That IS what a newbie would think.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Just as the Yiga Clan is immortal, so, too,
  is Master Kohga!<0 Type='4'/>That you'd dwell on such an insignificant
  thought shows that you lack training!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That brand-new gear... I take it you're
  the new guy?
  
  You're lucky to even be alive with our
  archnemesis Link out there scheming
  to bring us down.
  But no matter how cunning he is, he'll
  never infiltrate this hideout!
  
  So don't worry about him. Worry about
  developing vehicles and training troops.
