  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I wonder how the guy with the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> who
  crossed <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tabantha Great Bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to bring
  music and food to Rito Village is doing.
  I hope he's all right.

  Welcome to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tabantha Bridge Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Someone did cross the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tabantha Great
  Bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> saying, "I'll bring music and food
  to Rito Village!"
  I wonder how he's doing now...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I tried to stop him.<5 Type='0'/> I told him the blizzard
  was so dangerous, even seasoned
  merchants couldn't reach the village.
  But he just picked up his <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, got on
  the wagon he'd prepared on the other
  side of the bridge, and left.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>I hope he didn't stray from the path and
  wind up somewhere strange...
Talk01_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Oh no.<5 Type='1'/> That probably isn't going well for
  him at all.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>He can't get across the bridge that
  leads to Rito Village. It's collapsed under
  the weight of the snow.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e00540072006f00750062006c006500'/>But he's put himself in danger by taking
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>westbound road<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> out of here. It's often
  much too narrow for wagons.
  Worse still, the Upheaval created a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wide hole <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>along the way that'd be very
  hard to get past safely...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>So, your bridge is out because of the
  blizzard...<5 Type='1'/>and there's a terrible hole on
  the side of the road? 
  I should have tried harder to stop him.
Talk03_00_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You know, just before you came by...<0 Type='4'/>someone crossed <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tabantha Great Bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I tried to stop him.<5 Type='0'/> I told him the blizzard
  was bad around the village and that the
  path was dangerous...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But he'd already prepared a wagon on the
  other side of the bridge. He hopped on
  and away he went.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>I should have tried harder to hold him

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>Driving a wagon on the westbound road

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>If you have any questions about the area,
  you just ask your Auntie Banji!
  
  Just don't expect too much. Out of me,
  or the whole region, really.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>I mean, what you see is what you get!
  We're out here in the western boonies,
  so there's not a lot going on.
  Anything new you'll hear or find around
  here comes from travelers or merchants
  coming down that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>road <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>there.
Talk03_00_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I think it was just before you came by...<0 Type='4'/>Someone crossed over <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tabantha Great
  Bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> saying, "I want to bring music and
  food to Rito Village!"
  I tried warning him, but his wagon was
  already prepped on the other side. He just
  hopped on and headed off.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>western road<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> may lead to Rito Village,
  but the narrow bridge and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>huge hole<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> make
  it a hard route for a wagon.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Maybe if I asked the guy to play us a song
  on his <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>horn<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> before he left, I could have
  stopped him...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah, most stables and villages are
