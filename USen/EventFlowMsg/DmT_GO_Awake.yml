  OK! Let's head back!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_005_c: |
  And he wants me to inherit this? Really?
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_003_c: |
  So it's my duty to help you fight?
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_018_c: |
  With that ring, you'll be able to call on my power
  anytime, goro!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_008_b: |
  There's no way I'll let that happen! I can do this!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_014_b: |
  You can count on the Sage of Fire. I'll fight by your
  side till the very end!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_006_b: |
  I don't know if I'm nearly as great as my
  ancestor was...
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_012_b: |
  
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_004_b: |
  
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_011_bb: |
  I am the Sage of Fire! I've got an awesome new
  power, goro!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_019_c: |
  I promise. I'll be strong enough to fight beside you!
  No matter what happens!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_015_b: |
  And take this! It's proof I stand with you.
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_007_b: |
  But then... If I don't help out, I'd be letting everyone
  else down!
DmT_GO_Awake_Text_013_b: |
  Link... Hold out your fist!
