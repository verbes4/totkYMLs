  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>More like "chasms." You know, the creepy
  openings in the ground. Ever since the
  Upheaval, they're all over.
  In this area, they're <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>beneath Hyrule Castle<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>to the south of Lookout Landing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  I heard that members from the research
  team went rooting around in some and
  ended up in a bad way...
  It's best to steer clear.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>When the shrines appeared, it caused
  such a commotion that they landed in
  the newspaper.
  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Mysterious Shrines <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>Appear All Over the
  World Overnight" was smack on the front
  page, you know?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>So far we know they're from the age
  of legends...
  
  But did they fall from the sky or emerge
  from the ground?
  
  And just what ARE they, anyway?
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Aside from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shrines<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, we've also got the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>chasms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, of course.<5 Type='0'/>
  
  To tell you the truth, we don't know squat
  about all of the things that sprung up due
  to the Upheaval.<5 Type='0'/>
  But the shrines and chasms? They could
  be dangerous. Which would be scary. So
  we need to investigate them, pronto.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>WAH! <5 Type='0'/>You scared me!<5 Type='0'/> What are you doing

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>The people from the search party are
  putting in long hours at Hyrule Castle,
  so I intend to do the same.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>For all I know, this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shrine <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>could be
  dangerous too.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>My point is, lots of things are
  dangerous ever since the Upheaval.<5 Type='0'/>
  So be careful, OK?
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>WAH! <5 Type='0'/>You scared me!<5 Type='0'/> What are you doing

Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/>The Hyrule Castle<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> chasm <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is nearby.
  It's dangerous, you know?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>For all I know, this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shrine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> could be

  The Hyrule Castle<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> chasm <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is nearby, so
  my mind is on that at the moment. It's

  Too scary.
  It's probably best not to wander aimlessly

  I'm planning on finishing my shrine
