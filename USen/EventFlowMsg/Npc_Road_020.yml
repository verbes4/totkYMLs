  It seems like folks are allowed to pick
  up the eggs here. What few are left
  behind, at least.
  With this rain drowning out our footsteps,
  we might be able to get in there without
  ruffling any Cucco feathers.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Did you already forget the recipe for
  an egg tart?
  
  You'll need bird eggs, of course. Those
  can be picked up around here.
  
  They sell goat butter in Kakariko Village
  to the east and Hateno Village to the
  southeast, so that's easy enough.
  But Tabantha wheat only grows in the
  Tabantha region up northwest...
  
  And cane sugar is only sold in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to the northeast.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Maybe put that recipe to paper. I'd hate
  for you to do all that legwork only to
  forget again.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>This rain will make it easier to sneak up
  without the Cuccos taking notice. But
  there aren't many eggs for the taking...

  Not many layers there, eh?

  The ingredients are hard to get ahold of.
  
  You need goat butter,<5 Type='0'/> Tabantha wheat,<5 Type='0'/>
  cane sugar,<5 Type='0'/> and a bird egg.
  
  Goat butter's not hard to get. You can
  buy it in Kakariko Village to the east or
  Hateno Village to the southeast.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But like the name would imply, Tabantha
  wheat only grows to the northwest in the
  Tabantha region...
  And cane sugar? The closest source is
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the northeast.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>You might say that sounds like a lot of

  I'd hate for them to run away again,
