  The correct answer is "vasaaq." But I am
  impressed that you didn't throw out "va"
  or something.
  Novices want to abbreviate anything,
  but not everything in Gerudo can be
  shortened. That's what makes it difficult.
  Well, that, and the fact that Hylians seem
  to have a difficult time pronouncing the
  "va" sound.
  It's like this... You bite your lip, and...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/>"Va."
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Like that.

  What a shame for you to do so well only

  The correct answer is "vasaaq." The word
  "va" doesn't exist.
  
  Novices want to abbreviate anything,
