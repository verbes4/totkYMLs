  ever since I became a soldier...
  
  But... Sa'oten! To think I would see the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Don't...<5 Type='0'/>stand too close to me.
  
  
  I know that you're allowed to be here,
  but instinct might kick in and I may cut

  to break through. I'm relieved that we
  kept the chief and the people safe...
