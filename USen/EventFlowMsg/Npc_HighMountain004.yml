  so well.<5 Type='1'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I designed new training devices, but until
  the blizzard subsides, there's no way I'll
  be able to test them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>All I can do is protect this place as best
  I can.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>But don't worry about me. I have age and
  wisdom on my side. Or age, at least.<5 Type='0'/>
  Hoo hoo hoo!
Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>As you may have heard, I retired from my
  position as elder and entrusted the village
  to Teba's leadership.<5 Type='0'/>
  Now I spend my days here, at the Flight
  Range, helping mold the next generation
  of Rito warriors.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>I may look like an old fossil now, but I was
  quite the warrior in my day! I would have
  bested even Teba!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Not so anymore though. <5 Type='0'/>Hoo hoo...
TerrorLightning_00: |
  How distressing...
TerrorHorse: |
  Watch where you're going!
Talk24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Unfortunately, the equipment here has
  been damaged in the blizzard.<5 Type='1'/><0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>I would like to install new training devices,
  but there's no telling when I'll be able to
  actually do so.
Talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This is a meaningful place for the Rito.
  I feel a duty to protect it.
Talk26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>That said, the most these old bones can
  really manage is to prevent the Flight
  Range from being buried in snow.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>That's why I have to keep this fire going.<5 Type='0'/>
Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Spare some thought, though, for Teba
  and the villagers.<5 Type='1'/><0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>They are banding together admirably to
  overcome this accursed blizzard. <5 Type='0'/>Yet I
  can't help but worry.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>We can only hope the snows thaw soon.<5 Type='0'/>
TerrorArrow: |
  Stop that!
TerrorGuardian: |
  I'm doomed...
Talk28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hoo hoo... <5 Type='1'/>That archery set is left over
  from past training sessions.<0 Type='4'/>It's a shame they're simply collecting
  dust, <5 Type='0'/>but I have no other plans for them.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>You seem like someone who could put
  them to good use, Link. <5 Type='0'/>They're yours,
  if you want them.
