  Ha ha ha... There is no need for thanks. I merely
  watched over its renewal.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_012_b: |
  The Master Sword.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_004_b: |
  Go on then, Link. Draw it once more.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_010_b: |
  The potential of this fabled blade may well be limitless.
  Truly the work of a goddess.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_002_b: |
  And Link, keeper of the Master Sword.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_004_c: |
  
Dm_OT_0015_Text_000_b: |
  It is good to see you...
Dm_OT_0015_Text_004_d: |
  
Dm_OT_0015_Text_009_b: |
  The sword will continue to gain strength if bathed in
  sacred power. The stronger that power, the more
  powerful the sword becomes.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_007_b: |
  It is amazing that a sword can heal itself, no matter
  how badly damaged it becomes...
Dm_OT_0015_Text_005_b: |
  Great Deku Tree, thank you so much.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_011_b: |
  A sword...that grows ever stronger.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_003_b: |
  Your blade has been fully restored.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_001_b: |
  Princess Zelda of Hyrule.
Dm_OT_0015_Text_008_b: |
  It can do more than heal.
