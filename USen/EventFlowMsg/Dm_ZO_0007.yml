  taken place beneath Hyrule Castle!
  
  And afterward, you mysteriously awoke on
  a sky island...

  Zora's Domain yet?

  word that you had gone missing and was
  beside myself with concern.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Say, Link...
  
  
  Does it not seem that Princess Zelda's
  whereabouts might be related to the
  floating sky islands and the ruins?

  with our historian Jiahto. <5 Type='0'/>His many years
  have blessed him with great wisdom.
  It is quite possible that he could provide
  you with some useful information.
  
  At present, you should be able to find
  Jiahto continuing his investigation at
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Toto Lake<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>By the way... I hope you know that I am
  truly happy to see you again after such a
  long time apart, my dearest friend.
  Visit me anytime you like! Your presence
  is never anything less than welcome
  and appreciated.

  the domain...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>That aside, I am so grateful to hear that
  Lady Yona and the others are safe for
  the time being.
  Thank you for putting my heart at ease,
  Link. You are truly an exceptional friend.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>Now then. <5 Type='1'/>With that concern quelled for
  the moment, on to the bigger issue. <5 Type='1'/>My
  mind has been racing since we last spoke.
  Link, you said that you mysteriously
  awoke on a sky island, correct?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>The sky...<5 Type='1'/> Could it be that the sky is the
  key to everything after all?
Dm_ZO_0007_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Whatever could have transpired?!

  wondering if those floating sky islands
  could be the source of the falling sludge.
  That is why I have tasked a Zora historian
  with investigating ruin fragments and all
  historical documents related to the sky.

  spot at present, as I am uniquely qualified
  to deal with the sludge here.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>You see, old friend...<5 Type='1'/> This place is the
  source of the water that flows into
  Zora's Domain.
  That is why I must use my power of water
  manipulation <5 Type='1'/>to separate the sludge from
  our water in order to clean it.
  If I cease, then the sullied water will flow
  into our beloved home, and there will be
  much pain and suffering.
  That is why I cannot afford to leave here,
  no matter what.

  the whole of the kingdom, then.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Ah, Link! Before I forget...<5 Type='1'/> Have you,
  by chance, paid a visit to Zora's Domain?

  the domain to a Zora of incredible
  character. Her name is Lady Yona.
  Considering this mess with the sludge, it
  is a thorny task, to be sure.<5 Type='0'/> I cannot help
  but worry for her safety.
  If it is not asking too much, would you
  please go and see how she is faring in
  these trying times?
