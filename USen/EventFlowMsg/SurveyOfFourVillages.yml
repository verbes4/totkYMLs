  Right now, the Zonai Survey Team's

  If you want to know <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>about the Zonai<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hudson Construction<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is located there.
  They're the same folks who built Lookout
  Landing and the Skyview Towers.
  For some reason, Zonai devices are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>falling

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>There's got to be a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>special reason <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for it.

talk_3_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's a village in southeastern Hyrule called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's one of the largest
  Hyrulean villages there is.
  Robbie and I have a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lab<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> we use there as a
  base for our research.
  
  Fortunately that area hasn't been
  bothered by random objects raining
  down out of the sky.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Although, there's been unrest in the
  village, from what I've heard. Arguments
  breaking out. Things like that.
  Princess Zelda created a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>school<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> there
  and was trying to use the village as a
  starting point for restoring Hyrule.
  Up until recently, it was a very peaceful
  place, you see.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you want more info...
talk_3_34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's a fishing village called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  on the southeastern edge of Hyrule.
  
  The village is currently overrun by <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pirates<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Some villagers fled, while some stayed
  put, so they're scattered all over.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I feel like I should've kept a closer watch
  on that village. But it's far away, so news
  from there to here doesn't travel quickly.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you want more info...
talk47: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>The major cold front that descended upon
  the Rito, and the marbled rock roast that
  the Gorons couldn't get enough of...
  Then there was the sludge contaminating
  the Zora's water, and finally, the Gerudo
  menaced by Gibdos and a sand shroud.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You faced some serious challenges, and
  you overcame all of them. Well done, Link.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>So...the person resembling <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  was behind the scenes for all of the
  phenomena, as you discovered.
  This HAS to be related to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  somehow.

  The cold out that way has gotten even
