  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you're interested in the training area,
  you must be looking to refine your
  abilities, huh?
  Well, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Southern Oasis Training Area<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is
  where we've been working to improve our
  desert <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mobility<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Physical strength is important in fighting,
  of course, but being able to easily
  navigate the desert is valuable too.
  In fact, I'd argue that maneuverability is
  the most important part of surviving in
  the desert!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Captain Teake! Our current training just
  isn't enough for us to defeat the enemy!
  
  We need to be training at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Southern
  Oasis Training Area<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's the only way
  to win!
  If we improve our desert <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mobility<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  those monsters won't stand a chance
  against us...

  reopen the training area and get to work
  right away!

  to master it.
  Going out and training in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  would just be throwing your life away.
  
  Until the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> ends, we can't risk

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I can't worry about the training area
  right now... Better to focus on the battle
  at hand!
  Phew.<5 Type='0'/> Stay calm, Sudrey. <5 Type='0'/>Stay focused.
  Trust Lady Riju!

  Training area?
1002: |
  I should go.
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I hear you performed well! Where did you
  learn to fight?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I ask you this because that battle
  reinforced my belief that we need
  to train even harder.
  But...<5 Type='0'/>the captain is right. Acting on my
  impatience—my desire to do something to
  help—would do more harm than good.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>However!<5 Type='0'/> Once the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> clears

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I understand what you're saying...
  
  
  But right now it's a luxury that we even
  get this much space in the shelter
  for training.
  It's only enough room for sparring, so that
  will have to do for now.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0200'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0041006e00670072007900'/>Oh, would you give it a rest, Sudrey!
  
  
  I told you before—so long as the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand
  shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is around, we can't open up the
  training area!

  If we were able to train at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Southern

  The training area...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You may not have noticed, but I already
  sent reinforcements to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kara Kara Bazaar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  On top of that, I understand that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> herself is heading there as well.
  There's nothing for us to worry about.
