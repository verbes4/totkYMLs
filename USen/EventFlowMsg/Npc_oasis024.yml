  custom-modified spear?
  
  I'm not surprised—isn't it amazing?<5 Type='0'/> All my
  idea too!
Talk_PreDefense: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>What do you think of this? Pretty great,
  am I right?<5 Type='0'/> It was all my idea too!
  
  Who else would think to attach a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fire fruit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to a spear?
  
  Oooh, I can feel my fighting spirit yearning
  to be unleashed with this in hand!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>While voe in general are not allowed to
  enter the town, you helped us fight off
  the recent threat...
  Pass through with your head held high!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>This is it—my masterpiece. No one else
  would think of attaching a mirror to
  a spear!
  At first glance it may appear to only be a
  well-adorned weapon, but think about it
  for a moment...
  If the sun strikes this weapon on a
  cloudless day, the tide of battle will turn
  in your favor!
  How?<5 Type='0'/> From the sun's reflection blinding
  them, of course! They'll stop right in
  their tracks, dazzled by the light!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Don't worry. You have my permission to
  copy this amazing idea!

  this spear, would that be enough to let me fight back

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The battle was fierce, but in the end, we
  paid them back for our earlier failures.
  
  Unfortunately, the spear I made—the
  one with a fire fruit attached to it—broke
  during the fight.
  No lives were lost though! A spear is a
  small price to pay, all things considered.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hey, check this out!<5 Type='0'/> Isn't this attachment
  something special?
  
  One of the younger guards made it
  for me!

  captures a burning passion as well as
  this does?
  You'd think, living in a desert, I'd get sick
  of anything that hints at heat. But you'd
  be wrong!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I know, I know. <5 Type='1'/>You're a bit jealous just
  looking at it, right?<5 Type='1'/> You can make one
  yourself though! I won't stop you!
