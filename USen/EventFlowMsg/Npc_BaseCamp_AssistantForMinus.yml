  I was thinking...maybe there's some kind

Talk_New01_01_025: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So, you faced <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kohga<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the Depths? Hmm,
  what's the leader of the Yiga Clan up to
  down there...
  From what I know, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Yiga Clan <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is a
  super-dangerous group that schemes
  against the kingdom of Hyrule.
  And <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kohga<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> has had it out for you and
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for a long time. He'd do
  anything to put an end to your lives.
  Despite everything we're looking into
  already, we just can't take our eyes off
  this threat.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Besides, Kohga could know what's
  happened to the princess. That would
  make a lot of sense...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you do go after him, keep in mind that
  I'll be continuing my research of the
  Depths from right here.
Talk_New01_03_009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>The stone statues led to directly beneath
  Zora's Domain, and they discovered
  evidence of a civilization there!
  When we dug a little deeper, we learned
  that the statues in the southwest led
  beneath Gerudo Town.
  So I was thinking there may be a
  connection between the surface and
  the Depths.
  So I tried investigating the chasms in
  every region, to follow my hunch.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>And then we found a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>new chasm<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the cliff face at Rito Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in Hebra

  was there?!
  
  He's had it out for you and Princess
  Zelda for a long time. He'd do anything
  to put an end to your lives.
  We can't take our eyes off that kind of
  threat. He's dangerous.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Kohga might know something about
  what's happened to the princess. That
  would make a lot of sense...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you do go after him, keep in mind that
  I'll be continuing my research of the
  Depths from right here.

  This statue, right?
Talk_New01_02_003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We've also learned about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>still another
  kind of statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> than those that lead
  southwest.
  These are in Lanayru to the east. That
  region has many chasms. You'll find these
  statues at the bottom of two of them.
  One is on land<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> in the Lanayru Wetlands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  The other is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north of Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  All of these statues have a strong
  resemblance to the Zora.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>And these seem to lead <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>toward the east<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  Forest of Time south of Hyrule Field?
  
  There's a chasm there—and I've gotten
  reports of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>another series of statues <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>found
  at the bottom of it.
  These statues are different from the one
  you showed me using the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  They seem to point the way somewhere,
  too, and do come <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>near where you got
  your Autobuild ability<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But they don't stop there. These statues
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lead farther southwest <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>into the Depths.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Where they go is anyone's guess, but I
  bet there's a destination <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>far beyond
  that building<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> worth seeing.<5 Type='1'/>
1008: |
  Statues like this one?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Hi, Swordsman! <5 Type='1'/>Are your investigations
  into the Depths and the Yiga Clan
  going well?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I'm hard at work too.
  
  
  But I still don't have anything new aside
  from what I told you about the statues
  that seem to lead southwest.
Talk_New01_02_005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Given the first statues we investigated
  helped guide you to a destination...
  
  I think these statues are probably
  guides to somewhere too!
1009: |
  How about this picture?
Talk_New01_01_005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I haven't received any new reports yet.
  
  
  So I still don't have anything new aside
  from what I told you about the statues
  that seem to lead southwest.
Talk_New01_02_006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Multiple chasms have been discovered in
  Lanayru to the east.
  
  There's been some findings in the chasms
  on land<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> in the Lanayru Wetlands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north of Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Specifically, statues that seem to depict
  Zora were discovered there!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Considering the statue you found for
  me, Swordsman... You know, that very
  first one...
  My theory is...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>these statues are probably there to guide
  people to somewhere else too!
Talk_New01_01_006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You know the chasm in the Forest of Time
  south of Hyrule Field?
  
  Well, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>another series of statues<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> were
  discovered at the bottom of it!

Talk_New01_02_007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Gah, I'm so motivated right now!
  
  
  I'll keep gathering <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>info about the
  Depths <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so that I can be useful to
  you, Swordsman.
  Check back later, OK?

  Oh no! I bet it got all shredded up while
