  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>When the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Shrine Sensor<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> responds, then
  there should be a shrine nearby.
  
  More precisely, it'll react <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>when you are
  moving in the direction of a shrine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  Come on, let me see that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Purah Pad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  Yes! I whipped up some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>prototypes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of

  That is, with some help from you,

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>It'll react <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>when you're moving toward a
  shrine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. The more strongly, the more
  you're pointed in the right direction!
  So, if it's not responding much—or at
  all—try <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>moving in another direction<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  It seemed to go off more when you were
  pointed toward a section <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>of the slope
