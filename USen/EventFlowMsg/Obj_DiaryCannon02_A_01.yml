  Day Three
  
  
  The cave is bigger than any of us could
  have imagined.
  
  We explored inside by following the
  water downstream.
  
  When we were deep in the cave, we heard
  some hammering. I don't know how a
  sound from outside made it that far down.
  We will investigate tomorrow.

  Day Six
  
  
  Here are some highlights from the cave
  investigation report.
  
  -The cave continues all the way under the
  Skyview Tower.
  
  -The tower's weight may be a problem.
  We should build a reinforcement in the
  cave so it doesn't sink.

  Day Ten
  
  
  The tower is done! It was a breeze with
  Purah's clever design and the skillful
  prep work by Hudson Construction.
  All of that legwork kept on-site assembly
  simple and efficient.
  
  Since we may end up using the site again,
  we decided to leave some materials in
  the cave.
  The first thing I'll do when I get off this
  mountain is have a warm bowl of soup.

  Day One
  
  
  We've arrived at the site and
  started construction.
  
  Unfortunately, a heavy snowstorm blew
  in as soon as we started. We had to stop
  and take shelter in a nearby cave.
  Good newsâ€”the cave is warm and safe.
  We decided to use it as our base camp
  for the rest of the project.
