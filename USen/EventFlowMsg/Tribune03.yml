  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey, buddy... Have you seen some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>white
  goats<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> around here?
  
  I'd given those goats all the love and care
  in the world, but the other day, they ran
  off together.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>They didn't even finish all their food
  before they left—the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hylian pine cones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  weren't eaten!
  <FontSize Value='80'/>I followed Princess Zelda's recipe perfectly... But

Talk_0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>My poor white goats... Where did you run

  And why didn't you finish all your food

Talk_0503: |

  Thank you! I won't forget this!
Talk_0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah! <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>shared a recipe
  when she visited the stable a while back.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>It's really amazing how much she knows
  about animals. I never would've expected
  her to be developing healthy feed recipes!
  In this case, it's a recipe for a special
  kind of feed for white goats. The main
  ingredient is fresh <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hylian pine cones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's actually pretty unusual—it requires
  you to mix the pine cones in whole. You
  don't grind them down or anything!

Talk_0011_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I didn't want my wonderful white goats to
  eat the recipe the princess gave me, so I
  put it in a glass bottle...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But a big storm came through one day,
  and it blew the bottle off somewhere.
  
  I wasn't able to find it after that, so I've
  been making the recipe from memory
  since then.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But what would make my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>white goats<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> spit
  up the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hylian pine cones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and run off

  I have another theory...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Maybe the white goats set out to find the

  stand to eat the wrong recipe anymore.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Chork says the bottle that he kept

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>As a result, the feed he's been giving to
  his white goats was made from what he

  I can't believe that Princess Zelda would
  teach anyone a nonsense recipe. That

  It's important that we find these
  white goats...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But I think we should also find the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>recipe<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
