  did open the door.
0005: |
  That must be rough.
Near_00: |
  What a bother...
Talk_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>How did you get in there?<5 Type='0'/> I was pretty
  sure you couldn't get that door open
  without using the terminal...
0006: |
  I'm in a hurry, so...

  and hit the Skyview Tower!

  didn't we?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>I dashed here as fast as I could,<5 Type='0'/> and it
  looks like you're pretty fast too!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Did you come to see the Skyview Tower?
  <5 Type='1'/>I hate to say it, <5 Type='0'/>but things are a bit of a
  mess right now.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>It knocked off the lid that covers the
  hole at the top of the tower.<5 Type='0'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>I recently took a job as a carpenter for a
  company called Hudson Construction.<5 Type='0'/>
  
  At first, things were great. Everyone was
  really nice, <5 Type='0'/>and my boss taught me the
  basics and everything.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>But the day Hyrule Castle floated up,<5 Type='0'/> all
  sorts of things changed.
  
  Work started rolling in. It was endless!<5 Type='0'/>
  We've been busy ever since.<5 Type='0'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>They sent us new carpenters to check
  the Skyview Towers in each region. But
  there are only THREE of us doing that.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>*sigh* <5 Type='1'/>This work is going to keep us out
  in the field—away from our company—for
  a LONG time...

  something at least.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/><FontSize Value='100'/>Ugh.<5 Type='0'/> Look at me. Got away from
  myself there.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>That's not like me at all.<5 Type='0'/>

  long thing in the end.<5 Type='0'/> Sorry.<5 Type='0'/> Thanks
  for hearing me out.

Talk_28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>That means the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hole at the top is open<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<5 Type='1'/>
  And that's not all! <5 Type='0'/>After the impact, the
  door got stuck too.
Talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>The door is broken<5 Type='0'/> and won't open...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Phew! I finally can take a breather!<5 Type='1'/>
  The construction company's short on
  staff, which is a pain.
Talk_19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Let's see...<5 Type='1'/> Maybe if you used the
  terminal inside,<5 Type='0'/> that would force the
  door back open.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>But without a way to get inside, we're
  kind of stuck.
Talk_29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>A lot of ruins have fallen around this area.<5 Type='0'/>
  Really dangerous.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Always a good idea to keep your eye on
  the sky here, just in case <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ruins plop <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>right
  down around you.
