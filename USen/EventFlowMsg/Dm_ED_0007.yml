Dm_ED_0007_Text_006_b: |
  Wow... What a sight it is.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_015_b: |
  Rauru's power of light and Sonia's time power...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_fb: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_041_b: |
  Rauru and Sonia will be happy to hear of this.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_fc: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_046_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_bab: |
  to support Princess Zelda and...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_046_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_023_b: |
  Do not worry. You have overcome the burden my era
  left to you. You have proven yourself, and you
  no longer need me.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_037_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_028_d: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_059_c: |
  They wished not only to save Hyrule from the
  Demon King but for it to see eternal peace.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_005_b: |
  Whoa... I've never been this far up before, goro.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_014_b: |
  This is only a theory, but...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_028_e: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_040_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_019_b: |
  Now it seems...it is my time.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_028_f: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_045_b: |
  And I'll let them know...just how much you care.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_028_g: |
  swear on our lives,
Dm_ED_0007_Text_028_db: |
  Those of us,
Dm_ED_0007_Text_031_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_036_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_027_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_036_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_041_aab: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_062_c: |
  My friends...with all of your strength...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_027_d: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_058_c: |
  King Rauru... Queen Sonia... Mineru...
  The ancient sages...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_004_b: |
  Everyone... I am glad I was able to bring you all
  here. I wanted to share this view of Hyrule with
  all of you.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_027_e: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_cb: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_009_b: |
  I never thought I would actually stand here again.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_044_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_018_c: |
  I see.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_eb: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_030_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_000_ab: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_026_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_035_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_040_bb: |
  to support Princess Zelda and safeguard the land
  of Hyrule.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_061_c: |
  Now and for all time.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_026_d: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_026_e: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_003_c: |
  I can't believe such an impressive landmass can float
  in the sky.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_008_b: |
  Yes. Although I don't really remember.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_017_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_056_cb: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_003_d: |
  Just when I thought I'd started to figure the
  Zonai out...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_020_b: |
  Mineru!
Dm_ED_0007_Text_041_ab: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_025_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_034_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_039_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_060_c: |
  I would dedicate myself to that goal.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_025_d: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_025_e: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_007_b: |
  And, Zelda, you were roaming the skies all along?
Dm_ED_0007_Text_016_b: |
  For Zelda to transform back, they both must have
  channeled their abilities through you, Link.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_024_cb: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_028_eb: |
  gathered here,
Dm_ED_0007_Text_042_b: |
  But, Mineru...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_047_b: |
  Thank you, all...
Dm_ED_0007_Text_036_bb: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_024_b: |
  I know I can move on—join Rauru and the others—and
  the world will be safe.
Dm_ED_0007_Text_024_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_029_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_032_db: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_033_c: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_038_b: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_064_b: |
  stand with me!
Dm_ED_0007_Text_024_d: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_048_ab: |
  
Dm_ED_0007_Text_024_e: |
