  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>All right! What to do after this...
Balloon09: |
  So...tired...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>We certainly run into each other often,
  don't we? Would you like to shelter from
  this rain together?
Talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Don't mind me! I'm just, heh, definitely
  leaving everything just as I found it!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Wait!<5 Type='1'/> You're not with the survey team,
  are you?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Phew! I thought we were gonna get
  yelled at again.
Talk44: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='18005300750072007000720069007300650053005f0030003100'/>Hurry! I don't want to be outside when
  the thunder starts!
Talk45: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>So, isn't getting close up to this chunk
  here something at least?
  
  We can sweep up some of the fragments
  and sneak 'em away. We gotta study
  these ruins somehow...<5 Type='1'/>huh?
Talk16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We really want to become members of
  the Zonai Survey Team, so we came here
  to study the ruins.
  Did you know that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> have
  been found only in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  and nowhere else?
  That's why the Zonai Survey Team sent
  its <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>specialists<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to examine them.
  
  We figured this was a great opportunity
  to learn all sorts of things.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But Letty has been running all over the
  place to look at this and that, so we've
  gotten nowhere fast.
Talk46: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Naturally! Let's see how many of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>five
  Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> we can visit to see those!
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>So...hungry...
  
  
  I'm glad there are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>five<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> ruins around here
  to study, but it's exhausting running
  between them all.
Talk47: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda gave the order<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for
  everyone to stay away from it.
Talk18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We should cook up something refreshing.
  We have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>swift carrots<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so what do you
  think? <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Carrot stew<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Talk48: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Well, we can't visit that one, by <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>order
  of Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> herself. No one's
  allowed to go anywhere near it.
Talk19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oooh! Good idea!
  
  
  We even have all of the ingredients...
  swift carrots, goat butter, milk, and
  Tabantha wheat.<5 Type='0'/> Go for it, Totsie!
Talk49: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Sure, this is only a small chunk, but it's
  way easier to go hands-on with.
  
  We can sweep up some of the fragments
  here and sneak 'em away. We gotta study
  these ruins somehow...<5 Type='1'/> Huh?
Talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Huh? You want me to do it? I barely know
  which end to hold on a ladle.
Talk21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I mean, compare it to the main sites, like
  that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> over there. It's broken in
  two, but you can still see the full ring.
Talk50: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I hear that the village chief insisted on
  them being open about what they
  discover.
  The village is drawing a lot of tourists
  because of that.
  
  She seems pretty smart, despite only
  recently stepping into her position.
Talk51: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>But I barely even know how to start a fire!
Talk22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Well, darn. I was getting excited about
  that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>carrot stew<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk23: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Good evening! We certainly run into each
  other often.

  are so high up?
  
  I was told there were footholds, but it's
  basically a cliff!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I've heard that the Zonai Survey Team
  lets you use their balloons after you
  become a member.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>After we join up, we'll be able to do that
  together someday.
  
  For now, we'll have to make our way on
  foot while we study on our own.
NakedPlayer: |
  Where's the style in that?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Morning! We certainly run into each
  other often.
Talk53: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>How great!
  
  
  Kind of inspires me to make sure we study
  these ruins so we become super-smart
  members of the survey team!
Talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Hello! We certainly run into each

Talk26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Of all the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I wish we could
  enter that oneâ€”any part of it. And best
  of all, the section that's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>floating<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Aha! If the ruins fell here, then they
  must have come from some place in
  the sky, right?
  This is amazing, Totsie!
Talk28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>From the sky... You know, a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky-island
  specialist<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> works at the huge Ring Ruin
  on the northwest side of the village...

Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>What is happening? I'll just wait until this
  little climbing-on-things adventure is over.
Talk32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>The sky islands are those things just
  floating in the sky, right?
  
  I really want to ask him about what all
  that is up there!

  does it all mean?
  I want to join the Zonai Survey Team so
  I can help solve this mystery. But that
  will have to wait...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>All the rain makes things slippery, and
  then there's the thunder too. Scary!
  Mysteries can wait until better weather.
Balloon01: |
  Over here, maybe?
Balloon02: |
  *snore*
Talk07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone slab carved with writing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> was
  discovered in each of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>five Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  that fell around Kakariko Village.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm going to see one of them now!
Talk36: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>The ruins here are hugely important, and
  the Zonai Survey Team is pretty good
  about letting you know what's what.
  They even let people go read the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>writing they deciphered <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>on each stone
  slab for themselves. Pretty great!
Balloon03: |
  At last...
Talk37: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Come on! I'm sorry already.
  
  
  But after we're done here...want to see
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone slab <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>found in each of the Ring
  Ruins? Huge discoveries, they say!
Talk08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stone slab carved with writing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> was

  around Kakariko Village.
  I heard the Zonai Survey Team's leader
  is making sense of all that writing.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's truly amazing that he can read things
  that were written long, long ago!
  
  I want to learn to read this kind of
  writing someday too.
Talk38: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Then we'll just visit the Ring Ruins that
  we ARE allowed to enter.
