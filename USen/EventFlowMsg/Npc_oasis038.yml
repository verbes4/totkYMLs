  must understand your race environment

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, I never thought I would feel this
  inspired by a project again. And yet,
  my heart is filled with excitement.
  It's all because of you. You taught me
  how to use a steering stick. You set me
  on this new path. <5 Type='0'/>Sarqso.

  Hmm...if I do, I'll need to consider the
  impact on steering and control.
  
  Yes, I'll need to focus on efficiency and
  adjust the width of the hull...
