  in Zora's Domain on a certain day.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>Sasan always keeps his promises.
  However, this time...
  
  That day has already come and gone,

  on the day he promised he always would.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>Nothing like this has ever happened
  before, so I'm quite worried.
  
  It's too dangerous to leave because
  everything is covered in sludge.<5 Type='1'/> Urgh...<5 Type='0'/>
  I guess I'll have to wait here a bit longer.
