  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The caves around here are a good place
  to duck out of the cold, <5 Type='0'/>but be careful of
  lurking monsters.<0 Type='4'/>Some of them have pools of freezing
  water, too, on top of the normal cold.
  Always stay alert for danger.

  me those chillshrooms.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>I would've been so embarrassed coming
  back with nothing to show for it. You
  really helped me save face!

  the village, checking for signs of damage
  from the blizzard.
  The snow has stopped now, but that stuff
  was piled up everywhere for a long time.
  There might be lasting damage.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0401'/>What if the bridge gives way while
  somebody's walking on it? I can't let
  that happen!

  for a kid, she's a pretty good patroller.

  Finally, no more snow!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Notts and I are patrolling the village
  together. We haven't noticed too much
  damage, which is good.<5 Type='0'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But I won't give the all-clear for kids
  to start running around yet. Not until I'm
  sure it's safe!
