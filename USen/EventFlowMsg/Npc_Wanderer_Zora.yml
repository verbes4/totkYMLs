  would run into you here.<0 Type='4'/>We came to investigate the geoglyph in
  this region, but the sludge falling from
  the sky complicated things.

  our efforts to research the local geoglyph
  may resume.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The ancient literature states that the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten Temple<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is at the bottom of
  a canyon in Hebra.
  We believe that it will be integral to our
  understanding of the geoglyphs.
  
  Investigating the local geoglyph is still
  important, but I would like to find that
  temple as soon as possible.

  I propose we start there. We can find the
  temple in a canyon in Hebra.

  this area. We plan on taking to the skies
  to look for it.
