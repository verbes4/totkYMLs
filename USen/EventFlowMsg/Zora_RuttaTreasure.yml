  mystery. There was a passage in the text
  I mentioned that went as follows...
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>"The great fish. The eternal guardian.<5 Type='0'/>
  A secret treasure awaits just beneath
  the stony form of its statue.
  "Below the long bridge that reaches for
  the statue, leave your fears behind. <5 Type='0'/>Pass
  beneath two waterfalls to find your prize."
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003000'/>So! What do you make of it? It is like a
  good, old-fashioned treasure hunt,
  is it not?
  That said, it was a very old book, so it is
  questionable whether that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>secret treasure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  is still there, or ever was.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>However, if there is truth in those ancient
  words, this treasure may be of use to you.<5 Type='1'/>
  If you see fit, I encourage you to seek it!

  My apologies, but I fear I am still in the
