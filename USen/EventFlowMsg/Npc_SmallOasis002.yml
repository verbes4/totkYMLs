  Glad I've got wings.

  Sand shroud?
0004: |
  Goodbye.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Have you seen the thick layer of sand
  over the desert? That is the sand shroud.
  
  Should you be caught in it, not only will it
  obscure your vision but it will also make
  your compass go haywire.
  Thanks to that updraft over there,
  however, this oasis is secure.
  
  I've never been inside the sand shroud,
  myself. We<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> Rito<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> can simply <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fly over it<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk0022: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Another Hylian stranded out here by the
  sand shroud, I take it?
  
  Well, the storm has settled now, and
  visibility is clear in any direction you
  may care to look.
  It should be safe for you and your
  wingless kin to cross the desert again.
  
  As for me, I've grown fond of this little
  oasis. I think I'll bring my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>family<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> out here
  and make this place our forever nest.
0005: |
  You have a family?

  *sigh* I did it again. That was one part
  "goodbye" and one part "sav'orq."

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>My wife runs a general store in Rito
  Village. I'm not one to brag, but she's the
  most beautiful lady you ever will see.
  Our son runs a store of his own in some
  town or other, but I'm not entirely sure
  of all the details.
  The town itself was apparently established
  fairly recently in northeast Hyrule.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>As you might imagine, the two of them
  stay very busy, so it may be some time
  before we all live together again.

  Goodbye.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Ah, forgive me. Mixed up my languages
  there. That was one part "good morning"

  Perhaps I have been out here too long...

  The sand shroud's no trouble for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rito<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> like

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Dear me. I accidentally combined "good
  day" with the Gerudo "sav'aaq" there.
  
  Perhaps I've lived here too long...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>No, that isn't right. I just combined "good
