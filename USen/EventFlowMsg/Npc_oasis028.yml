  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We haven't found any endura carrots,
  but I think my husband and I will continue
  poking around here for now.
  You might have more luck searching for
  them at the top of the mountain though.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We were hoping to find some endura
  carrots, but there's nothing we can do
  in this rain.
  I would hate to put my husband's health
  at further risk.

  enjoy your partner's company.

  in the Yiga Clan?
  
  I've met a lot of people in my life, <5 Type='1'/>and I
  make a point not to judge people by how
  they look.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>But I don't think you should go into town
  with that outfit on.
  
  Unless you want to go to jail.

  came to our aid in Gerudo Canyon.
  
  Those Gleeok guts you gave us helped put
  my husband back on his feet.
  
  In other words, it's thanks to you that we
  can enjoy our wedding adventure.

  now, in hopes of further improving
  his health.
  They are said to grow around here,
  but so far, we haven't found any.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>It doesn't bother me much. I think we
  both get some pleasure out of searching
  for them together.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's starting to rain, I see.
Talk_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'd heard that this was a place where
  endura carrots grew.
  
  But we've scoured this whole area and
  haven't found any at all.
  
  Perhaps we had better look around at a
  higher elevation.
