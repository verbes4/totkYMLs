  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you can break this ore deposit in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>one

  I'm pretty confident in my skills, but with

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I thought you had it for a second.
  But maybe breaking it in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>one strike<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  just isn't possible.
  Hey, that's all right. No need to look so
  bummed out.
  
  I couldn't break it with my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sword <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>no
  matter how many times I hit it, and I'm
  a sword master.
  <4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>I like your grit. Even though you know
  it's impossible, you still want to try.
  
  If you ever want to give it another shot,
  let me know.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>I say that, but of course, soon I'll have

  like this?<0 Type='4'/>Doesn't bother me since I'm such a

  It's when the monsters come out.
  No shame in going back to the inn if
