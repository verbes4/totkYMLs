Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I remember thinkin' it was weird that it
  was the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>middle of the day<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and not night. I
  was just a baby, but I still remember it!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>You again, huh? Are you forgetful too?
Talk_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The only other thing I recall is that it was
  somewhere at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lake Ferona <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Eldin Canyon<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>... But that's it.
Talk_24: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>After retiring from the inn, I was looking
  forward to takin' a trip with you at last,
  just us buddies.
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Here I thought Volcon and I could finally
  take a vacation and go moongazing...
  
  But we can't very well get there if neither
  of us knows where it is!
Talk_25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>How could I forget? It was quite a sight!
  Goin' back there is a great idea.
  
  But what with the lava flows, the area
  has gotten confusing to navigate...
  
  I don't remember where it is. I'll follow
  you on this one, Volcon.
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>No time like the present to take that trip.
  Let's get a move on!
  
  Time to buckle down and prepare for
  the journey ahead.
Talk_26: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Uh-oh... I was countin' on you to
  remember how to get there, buddy!
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Sure thing. I just need another decade,
  and then I'll be ready.
Talk_27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I vividly remember the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>full moon shinin'
  on the ground<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, but nothing aside
  from that...
Talk_28: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I was sure you'd be the one to
  remember, bud...
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068004c00'/>That's the Tray I know. Quick as always.
  
  
  I surely won't be ready for at least
  another 15 years, m'self.
Talk_29: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>My memory is all fuzzy. Volcon, can you
  remember anything else?
Talk_11: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Yes! That's the place!
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If I could just see a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or something
  that shows the way the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>full moon shines
  on the ground <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>there...
  Pretty sure I'd be able to remember
  it then.
Talk_30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>It's no use... Nothin' is bringin' it to mind.
  
  
  Maybe if I could see a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or
  something that shows that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>full moon
  shining on the ground<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hey! That's the spot! That's just how the
  cave lit up when we were baby Gorons!
  
  That did the trickâ€”I remember how to
  get there.
  
  It was on the west side of Lake Ferona!
Talk_14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you, young Hylian. I can remember
  it so clearly now!
  
  It was really chappin' my hide, not being
  able to remember. I feel relieved to
  recall it.
Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm sure it wasn't easy to find!
  
  
  Take this as thanks from us.
Talk_33: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Speaking of, I heard a researcher at a
  place called Lookout Landing invented a
  tool to turn scenery into pictures.
Talk_16: |

  remember. Or somethin'.
Talk_34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Scenery into pictures?! What kinda thing
  can do somethin' like that?
Talk_17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I won't sleep till I remember.
Near_01: |
  So strange...
Talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Well, I do remember the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>full moon shinin'
  on the ground <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>there...<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  
  Other than that, I can't recall anything.
0010: |
  Full moon?
Talk_35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I just heard about it. I've got no clue how
  it works.
Near_02: |
  Where was it now?
Talk_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The marbled rock roast just up and
  vanished...<5 Type='0'/> Sometimes the strangest
  things happen.
  But the city's bustlin' again, and leavin'
  the work at the inn to that younger Goron
  means we've got time on our hands now.
  Maybe we should take a vacation, eh?
0011: |
  I'll leave you to it.
Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oooh, let's go somewhere we can really
  see the moon.
  
  I'm thinkin' about the place we were born,
  Tray. 'Member how the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>full moon shone
  on the ground<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> there?
0012: |
  Take a look at this.
Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Gorons are born of the land, ya see.
  
  
  Volcon and I were born from the same 
  place, so you could say we're
  rock brothers.
0013: |
  Goodbye.
Talk_21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>The city's all hustle and bustle again.
  And the inn's all sorted out with that
  young Goron.
  I was thinkin' we might take a vacation
  and spend time round where we were
  born. Beautiful moon views and all.
  But who woulda thought neither of us
  would remember how to get there!
Talk_04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We were born in a cave.
  
  
  But the full moon shone so brightly,
  lighting up the darkness of the cave. It
  was a mystical thing to see!
