  Maybe you're thinking a little basic—like
  a kitchen. Or a fully furnished room. Or
  something more. We're here for you!
  Maybe you want to add a nice space to
  display some of your favorite pictures. Or
  a place to care for your beloved horse.
  But that's nothing compared to what's
  really important—and what all of our
  customers truly enjoy—which is...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>the opportunity to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>assemble<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> all these
  individual <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rooms<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on their own!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>You pick the rooms you want, and then
  you can put them together the way you
  always imagined!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>That's the real core of the service
  we provide.
  
  We even give a little <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>commemorative gift<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to celebrate starting down the path to
  dream-home ownership!
  You know, our whole family is in your debt
  for all your help with Mattison.
  
  If you're interested in a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>dream home<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  I'll set you up with a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>discount<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>! It's my way
