  I firmly believe that Hateno Village's
  charm is in the delicious vegetables
  and milk from our farms.<0 Type='4'/>But there's no denying that these
  things just aren't resonating with the
  youth nowadays.<0 Type='4'/>And I've got no business being mayor if
  I can't fix that.<0 Type='4'/>So I got together with Nack, the best
  farmer in these parts, and we came up
  with a new type of pumpkin.<0 Type='4'/>The color, shape, and appearance are
  based on the Cece brand aesthetic,
  which is popular with the young folk.<0 Type='4'/>We've hit a snag though. It might be
  a bit before we can achieve our goal of
  shipping the pumpkins out.
