  Learnings of the Zora, Part One
  The Waters of Zora's Domain
  As told by Prince Sidon
  Long, long ago, right here in Lanayru,
  incredible transformations, both subtle
  and drastic in nature, shaped the land.
  The tall mountains birthed clouds, these
  clouds cried tears of rain, and this rain
  filled our deep valleys past the brim.
  In time, this overflowing water became the
  Zora River, which bred waterfalls that fell
  and nourished the vast Lanayru Wetlands.
  Perhaps it was inevitable that my Zora
  ancestors, who wandered in search of
  precious water, would finally settle here.
  The mountains of Lanayru are blessed
  with high-quality stone. The structures
  built from said stone are solid yet refined.
  Just like the Zora and our domain, our
  buildings exist in harmony with the water.
  It is a beautiful symbol of our way of life.
  If you go to the edge of the domain, close
  your eyes, and listen closely...you shall be
  greeted by the gentle sound of water.
  This kind, soothing sound is a testament
  to the happy life the Zora are so grateful
  to have found here.
  As one born of royal Zora blood, my duty
  is as clear as it is unshakable. I, Sidon,
  swear here and now...
  I shall protect our home with my very life,
  that the gentle sound of water may never
  cease in our beloved domain.

  The Princess of Hyrule
  As told by Prince Sidon
  Once that despicable disaster had ceased
  to plague Zora's Domain, a distinguished
  yet humble lady paid us a visit.
  This young woman who appeared with
  Link at her side was none other Princess
  Zelda of the royal family of Hyrule.
  "I beg forgiveness," she said earnestly.
  "Because of the royal family, Princess
  Mipha..." She paused, unable to continue.
  Small, silent teardrops tumbled down her
  cheek and hit the floor, one after another,
  each saying a thousand unspoken words.
  She gently wiped her eyes and lifted her
  gaze to meet the king's, speaking kind
  words of gratitude for Mipha's sacrifice.
  We knew well that what had transpired
  was the result of a decision shared by the
  Zora and by Princess Mipha herself.
  There was no need for the princess of
  Hyrule's apology, and even less so for
  her sorrow.
  King Dorephan, along with the rest of
  the Zora, were moved by the depth of
  Princess Zelda’s sincerity.
  She had held that unthinkable disaster
  at bay for nearly 100 years with nothing
  more than the sheer force of her own will.
  Yet she was not prideful. She dutifully set
  to work, traveling across Hyrule to secure
  cooperation for the kingdom's restoration.
  She was adored by all, yet so humble.
  She possessed an inner strength that
  shone like a star in the night sky.
  I used to think that inner strength could
  be forged by building physical strength,
  but now I am not so certain.
  I feel a strong calling to one day acquire
  this same sort of strength within myself.

  The Story of Mipha Court: The Conclusion
  As told by Prince Sidon
  The first half of this tale can be found on
  another stone monument. If it is not too
  much trouble, I advise reading that first.
  I now present the conclusion.
  
  
  When posed with the task of naming
  this storied location, I, Prince Sidon,
  fell silent.
  After a time, I timidly proposed the one
  and only name that came to mind for
  this place of newfound peace.
  I suggested that we name it after my
  beloved sister who had long been lost
  to us...Mipha Court.
  I worried they would think I was unfairly
  favoring my own family's legacy by
  naming it after my kin.
  A hush fell over the group. After a time,
  one of the stonemasons raised his voice
  in agreement.
  More voices joined his, one after another.
  The idea was embraced wholly, and the
  craftsmen all returned to their work.
  Though the work was grueling, from then
  until the completion of Mipha Court, the
  air was filled with laughter and singing.
  This incident drove home to my very core
  how much everyone loved my sister.
  
  I hope one day to inspire such admiration.
  If there is ever to be a Sidon Court, I must
  work tirelessly to earn that honor.

  The Legend of Ruto, Our Great Ancestor
  As told by Prince Sidon
  It is written that long ago there was a
  strong-willed Zora princess who was
  as meandering as a winding river.
  This princess, who was dearly loved by
  her fellow Zora, was as noble as she was
  innocent. Her name was Ruto.
  One day, a powerful and wicked man tried
  to take over Hyrule and brought great ruin
  to the once-peaceful Zora's Domain.
  Our tales speak of fallen Zora soldiers
  drifting down the river as it sadly reflected
  the chaotic retreat of the terrified Zora.
  Princess Ruto bravely fought back her
  tears as she bore witness to the tragic
  misery unfolding in the domain.
  Even amid her heartbreak, the Zora
  princess did all she could to help the
  weak and elderly escape.
  Next she swam against the river's current
  and climbed the mighty waterfall to
  challenge her foe.
  The details of this fight have fallen victim
  to the haze of time. Few details remain.
  
  Still, it is said that she was aided by
  the princess of Hyrule and the hero of
  legend, and together they saved Hyrule.
  So the legend goes.
  
  
  I, Sidon, prince of the Zora, cannot help
  but ponder these events as I listen to the
  Zora children play in all their innocence.
  As Princess Ruto's descendant, it is my
  fate to carry the torch of her brave acts
  into tomorrow and beyond. I shall not fail.

  Learnings of the Zora, Anecdote One
  The Solid Water and the Fluid Spear
  As told by Prince Sidon
  The Zora are not associated with water
  because of our dwelling place alone.
  
  We each also, to varying extents, possess
  the ability to actually manipulate water.
  We use this gift for many purposes.
  We use it to swim faster, to achieve
  mighty leaps from the waves below,
  to gather fish, and so much more.
  For me, the true awakening of this ability
  that many of my childhood chums already
  possessed came upon me quite suddenly.
  One day as I was training at Veiled Falls,
  the rain slickened my grasp, causing me
  to drop my spear.
  I reached to grab it, but it was already too
  far away. Soon it would fall to the bottom
  of the cliff, never to be seen again.
  I knew that I must take hold of it, and at
  that moment, droplets created a stream
  extending from my outstretched hand.
  The water stream twisted and turned until
  it finally took hold of my falling spear and
  deftly returned it to my grasp.
  In that moment, the water was solid and
  my spear fluid. This sensation forever
  changed my approach to spearplay.
  I was reminded of how my sister, Mipha,
  described it...and everything clicked.
  Water and spear became as one.
  Gaining yet another layer of admiration for
  my dear sister, I devoted myself to my
  spear training from then on.

  The Great King Dorephan
  As told by Prince Sidon
  Several springs after I lost my dear sister,
  Mipha, a large group of Lizalfos attacked
  the domain.
  It mattered not that this was my first true
  battle. The expectations of those around
  me weighed heavy on my shoulders.
  The absence of Mipha, who had always
  been there to encourage me with loving
  kindness, was like a spear to the heart.
  As for my own spear, though I was highly
  trained for its use, it seemed to only cut
  the air and slash the water's surface.
  I was taken off guard by a surprise attack
  from three Lizalfos hiding at the water's
  edge, each with their blade fixed on me.
  I knew that my time had come...and that
  is when the three Lizalfos disappeared,
  as quickly as they had arrived.
  In their place, I saw the towering figure
  of my father, the great King Dorephan,
  who had just bested my foes with ease.
  “Sidon, my son," he said firmly. "You
  allowed your heart to falter. That is the
  quickest way to fall on the battlefield."
  His words cut deep, but as I stood on the
  brink of despair, a familiar voice gently
  encouraged me. "Your king needs you."
  Many soldiers later attested that they
  were certain they had also heard the
  sweet voice of Mipha on that day.
  From then on, my heart was true and my
  resolve firm. By lending strength to our
  king, we were able to save the domain.

  Two Sisters of Different Blood
  As told by Prince Sidon
  When I was young, I had an irrational fear
  of strangers. I was particularly bashful
  around Yona. Paralyzed, even.
  She was already so mature in manner,
  and she treated me like a little brother,
  even though we were not related.
  There came an unseasonably heavy rain
  that quickly flooded the river. Us children,
  who were playing there, were swept away.
  I was battered by the water's strong flow,
  my fins helpless to resist. It was Yona who
  dragged me to the safety of the shore.
  The water continued to swell as the shore
  waned, but Yona was unflappable, sweetly
  comforting me as I shivered in fear.
  It was Mipha, my dear sister, who finally
  showed up to rescue us with other Zora
  adults in tow.
  I still remember Yona’s face as she gazed
  up at Mipha in admiration. My face must
  have looked the same as I gazed at Yona.
  As a child, I had two big sisters. One by
  birth and one by chance. Yona looked up
  to Mipha, and I was in awe of them both.
  Before I knew it, years had passed, and
  my feelings for Yona became more difficult
  to quantify. Then, one day...
  My father informed me that the amazing
  young woman who had once been like a
  sister to me was to be my bride.
  Perhaps these feelings and memories are
  too dear and private to commit to history,
  but such is the tale of this Zora prince.

  The Zora Armor She Left Behind
  As told by Prince Sidon
  For some time after I lost my beloved
  sister, even the light shining on the water
  seemed dark and dreary to my eyes.
  But as they say, time heals all wounds,
  no matter how deep. I can now speak
  of her with a smile, as is only fitting.
  I shall now tell the tale of the Zora armor
  that my sister crafted for her future
  husband, as per our ancient custom.
  One dark day, the domain was in great
  peril, and I sought help from a traveling
  Hylian to save our home.
  He was sparing with his words, yet I
  trusted him at once. As fate would have
  it, he was a childhood friend of Mipha's.
  My father, King Dorephan, troubled by the
  domain's suffering, requested his help.
  The swordsman agreed without hesitation.
  Father bequeathed my sister's Zora armor
  to this courageous soul, along with her
  hopes for the safety of the domain.
  The armor fit Link perfectly—so perfectly
  that councilman Muzu, who then harbored
  a hatred of Hylians, could not object.
  My sister had already left this world, and
  with her went the dearly held intentions
  she had instilled in that special armor.
  Yet, with Link's help, she shined a light on
  the Zora in our hour of need, reaching
  between worlds with gentle fingertips.

  The Story of Mipha Court: The Beginning
  As told by Prince Sidon
  There was once a terrifying monster on
  Ploymus Mountain, loosing shock arrows
  on all who dared to cross its path.
  It was of utmost importance to drive the
  beast away, but as the Zora are weak to
  electricity, our efforts were futile.
  That is when a lone Hylian arrived at the
  domain. This swordsman who was sparing
  with his words...his name was Link.
  Unlike us Zora, he was immune to shocks!
  Well, perhaps that is an exaggeration, but
  one thing is certain. He was very brave.
  After careful preparation, he ascended
  Ploymus Mountain and defeated the foul
  beast all by himself.
  As if in celebration of the newfound
  peace, clean water mysteriously began
  flowing at the top of Ploymus Mountain.
  That is when many Zora, if not most,
  voiced support for building a place that all
  could enjoy in that formerly frightful spot.
  Yet the many tree roots and stones made
  this task tricky, leading to a focus on the
  no-less-difficult matter of the name.
  "Zora Park" was too obvious. "Ploymus
  Park" only conjured images of the former
  terrors found there.
  When I candidly asked whether we should
  focus on the hard work at hand rather
  than the name, they all turned my way.
  “Prince Sidon," they asked. "Surely you
  must have a good suggestion?” To that,
  I fell silent, and stayed so for a long while.
  I shall write the conclusion of this story
  on another monument.

  The Prince and the Swordsman
  As told by Prince Sidon
  The rain always stops...except when it
  does not. This humorous saying was once
  repeated with a soft chuckle around here.
  Then, one day, heavy rain started falling
  in the domain, and no matter how many
  days passed, it did not cease.
  Although the Zora are a water-dwelling
  sort, we came to miss the warmth of the
  sun and the dry winds upon our backs.
  Alas, as fervent as our desire was, we had
  no means of stopping the cause of this
  unprecedented disaster.
  When all had given up hope, I, Sidon,
  took it upon myself to invite a Hylian
  to the domain.
  This young swordsman of few words was
  named Link. I trusted him at once,
  sensing great devotion in his kind eyes.
  It was immediately clear that my instincts
  were correct. Thanks to Link, we were
  able to face the threat head on.
  Our battle with the source of the disaster
  was intense, but my newfound friend and I
  refused to yield until we finally triumphed.
  Sometimes, written words flow so much
  more readily than those spoken...
  
  Link, my dearest friend, you are an
  unparalleled swordsman, and I admire
  you so very much.
  He may lack fins and gills, but it matters
  not. This hero among heroes exudes
  magnificence tempered with steadiness.
  Though we are different, our hearts both
  yearn to serve a higher calling. I learned
  much from him, and am eternally grateful.
  As I recall my best friend, it occurs to me
  that though the rains have ceased,
  perhaps a true adventure never does.

  The Great Task Entrusted to Me
  As told by Prince Sidon
  I, Sidon, was entrusted with the great
  task of renovating the Zora stone
  monuments that had fallen to ruin.
  There are 11 stone monuments total
  found in and around Zora's Domain,
  including the one you are now reading.
  The former text written by my father,
  King Dorephan, could not be salvaged,
  and so sadly it had to be replaced.
  Despite my royal blood, whispers abound
  that it is improper for someone my age to
  write over the king's glorious words.
  Ah, but do they not realize that it was
  King Dorephan himself who ordered me
  to undertake this restoration project?
  Father says it is not set in stone that I
  shall be the one to inherit the throne,
  as it is not a matter of blood alone.
  If we ask the eternal skies above whether
  I am fit to rule, they shall remain silent,
  and so we must look to our fellow Zora.
  He urged me to use these monuments to
  share my learnings and speak to our
  people straight from my heart.
  Father is older and wiser than I. His sage
  advice is a gift. As such, I have inscribed
  my thoughts upon these 11 stones.
  I do not know how far-reaching my words
  shall be, but it is my hope that they will
  reach whoever needs to hear them most.
  Until one of my descendants writes over
  my musings many years from now, I pray
  they resonate with whoever reads them.
