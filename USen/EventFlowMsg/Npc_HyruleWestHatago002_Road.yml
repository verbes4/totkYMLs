  What a coincidence! <5 Type='1'/>I suppose fate really
  wanted the two of us to run into each

  the two fools talking in circles about
  swords and beasts.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I finally got fed up with them and decided
  to go on a solo adventure exploring my

  You're alone too, right? <5 Type='1'/>Alone is good.<5 Type='0'/>
  It means you don't have to put up with

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I got into a nasty argument with my
  older brothers about where to go on
  our adventures.
  They wanted to chase down stories about
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>legendary sword <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>or some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rumored
  beast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>... Nonsense, all of it!
  I told them, <5 Type='0'/>"Why waste our time on
  crackpot theories instead of exploring
  the real, tangible <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ruins <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>around us?"<0 Type='4'/>But we just kept arguing in circles.
  Finally, I decided to leave them behind
  at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>New Serenne Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>I wonder what the two of them are
  doing now... <5 Type='0'/>Probably just where I left
  them, bickering over fairy tales...

  Recently, some of the ruins were hit by
  falling debris and lost their shape...
  
  But still, they're wondrous. Absolutely
  worth the trip to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>I mean, if the Zonai Survey Team is

  That thing on top... I mean, that's got to

  Supposedly there's a shrine on top

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>It's easy to understand, but something
