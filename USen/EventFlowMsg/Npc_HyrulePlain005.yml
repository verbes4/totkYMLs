  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'm always happy to talk, but would it be
  all right if we moved this conversation
  under a tree and out of the rain?
Talk_1018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I don't really know what this all means...
  
  
  But it's the duty of a stable to keep its
  guests safe, so I can't help but worry.
Talk_2100: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There's nothing cuter than the sleeping
  face of my granddaughter.
LargeHorse: |
  It's clearly fond of you.
GoldHorse: |
  What a beautiful creature...
Talk_1019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So if you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>also<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> plan to go to the city, watch
  out for Gorons with strange rocks.
Talk_2101: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, excuse me. If you would like me to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>show you around the area<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I'd ask you
  to please wait until morning.
  This little girl is my granddaughter. She's
  been fascinated by the sky ever since she
  was able to lift her head.
  Since the Upheaval, her eyes and
  imagination have been fixed on those
  islands floating up there.

  her now.

  Also?

  Strange rocks?

  It's not letting up...
Near_101: |
  I swear, this weather...

  I hope they're all right...

  Goodbye.
Near_03: |
  Looking for directions?

  Goron City, Zora's Domain, or Hyrule
  Castle, just say the word.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Oh, setting out this early, are we?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>If you proceed up the mountain path,
  you'll find Goron City at the very end of
  your climb.
  The Gorons are wonderful folks, and just
  wait until you see the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>prices on the ores<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  at YunoboCo's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mineral market<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  strange rocks that made them act up a
  little, but that's all over now.
  The Gorons are back to their welcoming
  selves, so go ahead and pay them a visit.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Oh, do my eyes deceive me? Or do you

  best option is to follow the river upstream.
  
  You'll know you've nearly made it when
  you see the shiny blue entrance gate.
Talk_1022: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>The monsters are out on the prowl around
  now, and you're still setting out?
Talk_2000: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Most of the travelers who stop by our
  stable are headed toward Goron City,
  Zora's Domain, or Hyrule Castle.
  Guiding them to wherever they're going
  is one of my roles here.
  
  Is there anywhere I can guide you?
0006: |
  Where's Goron City?
Talk_2013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I hear that the Zora are dealing with this
  strange, falling sludge right now.
  
  Though I'm afraid I don't know much
  about it myself.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There's a stable out east near Zora's
  Domain—Foothill Stable.
  
  Maybe the proprietor there can tell you
  more about what's going on.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>My, even the rain isn't enough to slow

Talk_1010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I take it you're <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>also<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> headed to Goron City.
  
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>This may be an odd warning, but do try to
  watch out for Gorons with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strange rocks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_2001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You don't really plan on going out and

  Where's Zora's Domain?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>By the way, that sludge that was troubling
  the Zora is completely gone. I'm sure
  they're even more relieved than I am.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>My, setting out at this hour? Not much of
  a sleeper, are you?
Talk_1011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You look like an experienced traveler, so
  you'll probably be fine, but...
  
  If you're <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>also<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> headed to Goron City, be
  careful of Gorons with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strange rocks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  It is my job, after all.
0008: |
  Where's Hyrule Castle?
BoneHorse: |
  What a strange mount.
Talk_1012: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There's a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>restaurant<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> up this mountain
  path toward the city.
  
  I pointed a traveler in that direction quite
  some time ago, but there's been no sign
  of them coming back.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It's hard not to imagine they've gotten

  your eye on the floating Hyrule Castle...
  
  You'll find yourself in the middle of
  Central Hyrule looking up at it before
  you know it.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>It was a truly beautiful castle once, but
  now it looks so sinister...
  
  I've heard rumors that the princess might
  still be sealed away in there.
  
  Whether that's true or not, I'll still be
  praying for her safety.

  Goodbye.
Talk_1013: |

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0041006e00670072007900'/>But lately it seems the young ones have

  I met one injured traveler who told me
  that the Gorons in question all carried
  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strange rocks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."
Talk_2017: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>There are more monsters out at night.
  If you're feeling tired, why not rest until

  don't be shy about coming to us.
WakkaCharm: |
  Well, isn't that fancy?
Talk_1015: |
