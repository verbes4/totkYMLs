  Ancient power?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>Indeed. <5 Type='0'/>Apparently, it allows you to

  something that you've built before.
  That <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strange stone statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is a "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>construct<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  that can supposedly grant us that power.
  
  But we don't know how to wake it up.<5 Type='0'/>
  Hmm...<5 Type='0'/> There has to be some way to get
  it to respond, right?

  What is important is this text we're
  investigating. It's fascinating.
  
  It claims that this stone statue should be
  able to grant us an "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ancient power<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>That's right. This <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>peculiar stone statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  is nothing less than one of the fabled
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>constructs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>In fact, I have some writing here that
  explains this so-called "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ancient power<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  in detail.
  It reads, <5 Type='0'/>"This ability will allow you
  to commit <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>any structure you create<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to memory.
  "Any object committed to memory
  can be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>instantly reproduced<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."

  re-create anything we'd ever made...
  
  the Yiâ€”<5 Type='1'/> Er, I mean, the survey team's,
  uh...investigation of this land would be
  swift and unstoppable!
  The text further claims that this construct
  should be able to grant us that power.
  Oh, we just have to wake it up!
