  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, hello.
Talk_0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's nice of you to come all the way to
  the construction site.
  
  But I'm all right.
  
  
  I just hope it inspires Mattison to see her
  papa working hard.
  
  Anyway, I've been looking at ways to
  make use of the Zonai devices that
  have fallen around here.
  It's all part of this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>development project<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  I'm doing with the folks of the Zonai
  Survey Team.
Talk_0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The ground around here is really loose.
  
  
  Sometimes recovering a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zonai device<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or
  moving the ruins causes it to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>collapse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>YunoboCo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, this place would wind up
  covered in Zonai ruins.
  And it'd be especially awful since
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>President Yunobo <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>went out of his way
  to help us.
  So, no carelessness and no accidents.
  Oh, and make real sure you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>watch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>where
  you step<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_0028: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, for starters, those balloons
  the Zonai Survey Team is using...
  we made them.
  You see, there's this Zonai device that
  floats when you add heat.
  
  We attach a basket to these things and
  then folks can jump in and go for a ride.
  
  And right now, we're working on these
  vehicles that use a wheel-like device...
  but this device rotates automatically.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Truthfully, we've got the vehicle base
  down, but safety and handling is still an
  issue. Can't say they're practical yet.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I was supposed to meet <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kilton<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> here.

  If you're curious about that stuff, chat
  with Fernison. She's the survey-team

  Ah, but you'll have to wait. She's busy

Talk_0033: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The balloons the Zonai Survey Team uses
  are made out of a basket attached to a
  Zonai device that floats when heated.
  Now we're working on a vehicle that uses
  a wheel-like device that rotates by itself.
  
  But...well...there are still a few handling
  and safety issues, and that's slowing
  down our work on it.

  Sounds like they've finally found a way to
  control the vehicles. That means we can
  start testing them out for real.
  If you're curious, go chat with Fernison.
  She's the survey-team member in charge
  of that area.

  That was a rough patch there, but I feel
  a lot better about things thanks to you.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>There has to be something I can do for
  Mattison. I'm her papa, after all. <5 Type='0'/>Hmm...

  I'm sure they'll take good care of her.
