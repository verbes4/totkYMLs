  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Well! <5 Type='1'/>Never thought I'd run into someone

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>This cliff crumbled during <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  so this is as far as anyone can go.
  
  It's so bad that it put <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Canyon
  Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> up ahead out of business.
  
  If you were hoping to find a place to rest
  and restock, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kara Kara Bazaar <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>out <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>toward
  the desert <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is your only option.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But the temperature in the desert shifts
  from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>extreme heat to extreme cold<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and
  walking through sand is a challenge.
  If you want to cook something to prepare
  yourself, you're welcome to use my pot.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Traveling in the desert is really tough.
  
  
  Take one step off the road and you'll be
  up to your knees in sand. If you plan on
  walking, plan on walking slow.
  Honestly, it almost makes me wish I'd
  thought ahead and borrowed a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand seal<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  right at the start.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But I swore to myself that I was going to

  blocked. The Upheaval messed things

  If you need to get to the Digdogg

  The debris completely blocked off the

  Luckily, they made a new one. If you're
