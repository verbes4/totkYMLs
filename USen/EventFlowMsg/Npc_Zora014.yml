  I wish Jiahto knew how frustrated I am!

  crumbled due to the Upheaval.<5 Type='0'/>
  
  Miraculously, an ancient ruin appeared.
  
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>I am pleased that Prince Sidon asked the
  Zora historian, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Jiahto<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, to investigate.
  
  However, he is far too interested in
  satisfying his curiosity for those ruins and
  simply will not provide us with a report!

  It was refreshing for this old warrior.
