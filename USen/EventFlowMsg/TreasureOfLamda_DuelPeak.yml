  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>I think I've narrowed down where those

  Yeah, I'm sure of it!
Talk18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Pleasure doing business with you!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Trust me, that was a steal. If you find the
  treasure, it'll be worth way more than a
  measly <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>100 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk41: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/>Hold on, I'm thinking.

  Refresh my memory.
Talk42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Listen, you! That's the last morsel of

  conversation without you listening in?!
0011: |
  Never mind.
Talk43: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>What is it? <5 Type='0'/>We already told you all the
  old manuscripts had to say.
Talk03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/><4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003100'/>Yeah! <5 Type='0'/>We're not gonna tell you one word
  about <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the bandit Misko's old manuscripts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
0012: |
  I found the treasure.
Talk44: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Wait, are you wearing the treasure now?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>Hm?<5 Type='0'/> Sorry, what?<5 Type='0'/>

Talk46: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I admit, that kind of stings, but...so be it.
  There are other treasures out there.

  ours, and this guy'd never work out these
  riddles, even if we told him.
Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Always a pleasure!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Thing is, I'm not about to give that info up

  first old manuscript? You only get one at
  a time, that's the rule!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>We've already solved both of these other
  ones, haven't we, Dak?
0002: |
  No need.
Talk34: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Naturally.<5 Type='0'/> There's no riddle that can't be
  solved once it falls into my hands.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The one I gave you was pretty easy,
  though. If you think long and hard about
  it, you might be able to figure it out!
0003: |
  You got a deal.
Talk35: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>Not gonna lie, this one's a real doozy
  of a riddle. It's hard to solve from the
  manuscript alone.
  But I'll tell you the answer, if you want!
0004: |
  I don't think so.

  Or do you want me to refresh your

Talk39: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Yeah, and we'll get the next one!
  You'll see!

  I'm good for now.

  Tell me a new one.

  you want to hear?
Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're back? <5 Type='0'/>We already told you what all
  the old manuscripts had to say.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Oh, I get it. You forgot, huh? Well, fine.
  Pay attention and I'll tell you again.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Which of the old manuscripts <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>did you want
  to hear?
Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Well, look at this guy! He thinks he can
  find the treasure without the manuscripts.
  Yeah, good luck with that.
