  I gotta keep a close eye out in case any

  Without A-Zoom on the job, the bad guys

  Robbie's lab in northeast Akkala?<0 Type='4'/>There's also a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>research lab <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>at the top of

  A-Zoom's blind spots and take it over?
  You gotta keep my secret!
Talk_8001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>The curry you gave us was really good.<0 Type='4'/>Maybe A-Zoom should have his own
  special curry recipe. Whaddaya think?
Talk_6018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Um, let's see. It doesn't look like the bad
  guys are interested in Ms. Zelda's house
  on the edge of town.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Mom said Ms. Zelda might not ever come
  back. But I still believe!<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>A big reason A-Zoom keeps an eye on
  things is so Ms. Zelda can come back
  anytime she wants!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Ummm, let's see... Teebo's house is the 
  closest one, and I haven't seen any bad
  guys there.<0 Type='4'/>Teebo's dad was the gatekeeper here,

  mom though. What was it she said?<0 Type='4'/>Something like, "It's a real shame she's
  not more interested in fashion!"
Talk_6019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmm, let's see. <5 Type='1'/>One spot I've been

  fashionable farmer in the village.<0 Type='4'/>But he hangs out a lot with Reede, the
  village mayor, and that guy doesn't care
  about fashion at all. So I don't get it.
