  we received <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>eyewitness accounts of large
  monsters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> at monster-control-crew HQ.
  
  The monsters were spotted roaming in a
  few different regions. We just wrapped up
  compiling all of the info on them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'd be happy to tell you all about it.
  
  
  But you've got to be tired, so please take
  some time to rest up and check in with
  me later.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Link. Thank you so much for hunting down
  those three beasts.
  
  I was wondering if I might...trouble you
  for help yet again.
  
  Just recently, we've received troubling
  accounts about monsters we've never
  heard of before.
  We're hard at work gathering what
  intel we can regarding these new
  fearsome beasts.
