  see anything I can take.
Talk_42: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Did you have somethin' to say?
Talk_37: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Might've just been my imagination.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>A gift from Cece? Thanks for that.<0 Type='4'/>The world of fashion moves too fast for
  us <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>old folks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>But I'm in favor of any mayor who can
  make sure this village stays a place where
  the younger folk are happy to live.
Talk_38: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Eh? What do you want with an old man
  like me?
Talk_44: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Not sure I understand what you're
  meanin' to give me. Could you maybe
  have dropped it somewhere?
Talk_50: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Um...<0 Type='4'/>I get the sense you brought me a gift, but
  I'm not sure what it was supposed to be.
Talk_39: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>You say this is from Cece? Well...that's
  generous of her. Thanks.
Talk_51: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Seems like lately, Cece's mushrooms are
  popping up everywhere around here.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Makes my eyes water a bit to see those
  flashy colors wherever I turn.<0 Type='4'/>My <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>family<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and all my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>friends my age<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> tend
  to take life slower than she does.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>Still and all, it'd be rude to turn down
  a generous gift. <5 Type='0'/>Thank you.

  related to the inn?
Talk_52: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's our farm's specialty. Or it was.<0 Type='4'/>We use acorns in our cows' feed, and I
  haven't been able to get my hands on
  any lately.<0 Type='4'/>If you do need some milk, you might
  check the general store. It's possible
  they have some left.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh* <5 Type='0'/>All I'd need is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>three<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>acorns<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to mix
  up some more feed for the cows, and I
  can't even get that.
Talk_46: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oooh! For me? Thanks!<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>My wife loves Cece stuff, so I'll save it as
  a treat for her.<0 Type='4'/>I'm not too into the designs myself, but
  she is pretty pleased with them.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>And she does look incredibly cute when
  she wears them too! Yeah, that Cece is
  all right in my book.<0 Type='4'/>And I'm not the only one. Koyin from the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farm <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>on the hill said the same thing.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Might've just been my imagination.
  I have been a mite preoccupied taking
  care of my cows.
Talk_47: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>No? Then feel free to stay at the inn,
  if you like.

  see anything I can take. Maybe you
  dropped it somewhere?<0 Type='4'/>Anyways, I'd better go back to tending
  the cows.
Talk_48: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>...<5 Type='1'/><0 Type='4'/>Did you...still need something?
Talk_60: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I get the sense that the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>older villagers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  take little interest in their clothing.
Talk_55: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah, it's my farm's specialty. Didn't I
  mention it?
Talk_49: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You brought this from Cece? Wow, uh...
  Thank you!<0 Type='4'/>There's a lot of ways you can prepare
  mushrooms. They're tasty on their own
  too. I just like 'em, OK?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>But...that's when they're food. When you
  make them fashion, you lose me.<0 Type='4'/>It wasn't so long ago that doing stuff like
  that was completely unheard-of here.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farm families<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> don't know what to
  make of it either. Can you blame them?
Talk_61: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Something tells me that many <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>farmers <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in
  this village are sadly unacquainted with
  the latest trends.
Talk_56: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You tell Cece I said thanks, all right?
Talk_62: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I've heard it said that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>those who work at
  the pasture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> here care little for fashion.
  Go and see about changing their minds.
