  That's OK. First time for everything, as
  they say.
  A Goron-style massage is done on top of
  a hard rock bed. <5 Type='0'/>Pressure is applied to
  your body to squeeze all the tension out.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>S'right! It doesn't hurt one bit.<5 Type='0'/> Mostly.<5 Type='0'/>
  I tell ya, I even doze off sometimes!
  
  Afterward, you'll sleep like a rock and
  feel great when ya wake up. You'll be all
  limber and full of energy!
