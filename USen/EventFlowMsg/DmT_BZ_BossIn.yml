DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_017_aab: |
  Did my puppet entertain you? She made it so easy to
  mislead youâ€”to keep you occupied...
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_000_b: |
  At last...
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_001_b: |
  I have been waiting for you to arrive.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_002_b: |
  Now, Link... There is something here I want to
  show you.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_003_b: |
  What do you think?
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_004_b: |
  Hyrule Castle. Perfect and glorious.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_005_b: |
  Does it awaken memories?
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_006_b: |
  Memories of our time here?
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_007_b: |
  Well, really take in every detail...
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_008_b: |
  After all, this place...
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_009_b: |
  will be the last thing you ever see.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_012_b: |
  The fabled swordsman who endured my corruption...
  Who has persisted in slaughtering my servants...
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_013_b: |
  Interesting... How is it that you survived my attack?
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_014_b: |
  It must have been that wretched arm.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_015_b: |
  
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_016_b: |
  No matter. You will not live to see another sunrise.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_017_ab: |
  But such an indirect approach is no longer needed.
DmT_BZ_BossIn_Text_017_b: |
  End this hero's life, my dark servant. Cut him down.
