  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Rock roast is the greatest thing to happen
  to Hyrule.
  
  Yes, indeed. It is the finest of edible
  delicacies and a necessity for us Gorons.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>I put down some tracks <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so we could load
  up on stock easily.
  
  But even with the tracks, it can be a
  challenge for Gorons to collect rock roast.

  Ours is the finest restaurant in Hyrule,

  Whether you're a Goron or Hylian, I have

  If you're hankerin' for a steak, please
  order directly from the grill.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I have to say, I'm relieved you're a Hylian.
  
  
  Right now, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rock roast <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is in short supply,

  In that state, I wouldn't be able to use it
  in my cooking.
  
  But if you happen to have any untainted
