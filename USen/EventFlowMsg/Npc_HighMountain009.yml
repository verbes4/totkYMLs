  Mostly we investigate what the deal is

  sky along with the blizzard. It's been
  raining down junk on us ever since.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>Not only that, we have to deal with these

  anything like them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Most of us are focused on checking out
  the mountains themselves, but some are
  looking into Rito legends and fables.<0 Type='4'/>We're casting a wide net with this one.

  so you can still find fish and mushrooms
  inside them sometimes.
