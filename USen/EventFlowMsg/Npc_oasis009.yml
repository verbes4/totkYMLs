  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Ugh... Those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gibdos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are a nuisance...
  They keep attacking us from the cover
  of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  If it weren't for Lady Riju and her
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lightning strikes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, we'd have been
  wiped out already.
  Grrr... We're supposed to be protecting
  her, not the other way around. What kind
  of guards are we?

  seal<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rental shop<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you can always

  But they're very <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sensitive to sound<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Lady Riju hasn't been able to completely
  master her <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>control over lightning<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>... If only
  I could do something to help her.
  So sore... <5 Type='1'/>I guess I should focus on my
  own recovery, but... Ugh, I just feel
  so pathetic.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Riju<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> may be the core of our fighting

  catch these monsters off guard this time!

  and go as you please.
  
  Now that the sand shroud has cleared up,
  you can really appreciate the beauty of
  the desert. Just look at that view!<0 Type='4'/>When I want to relax, I rent a sand seal
  from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rental shop<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> over there and
  explore the desert.
  Because of you and the chief, it's safe
  to go out and really appreciate the
  desert scenery!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>The defense of the town isn't just on Lady
  Riju's shoulders! We'll all do our part to
  keep everyone safe!
Talk_AfterDefense: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>There's no way to know if they'll be back,
  but for now, we've driven them off and
  that's a huge victory.
  If they come back, I'll stop them from
  getting through this gate—with my life,
  if I have to!
Talk_InBattle: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Don't let them reach Lady Riju!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm protecting this area. I won't let the
  monsters get into town again.<5 Type='0'/> I swear it!
