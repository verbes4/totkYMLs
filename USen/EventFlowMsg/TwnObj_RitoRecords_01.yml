  Stormwind Ark song.

  One day, winds at the village roared back
  to life. In shock, the villagers looked to
  the sky.
  Floating above them was an enormous
  ship that the god had sent in gratitude.
  
  Numerous oars on both sides began to
  move like wings, soundlessly churning
  the skies...
0004: |
  Leave.
Talk0018: |
  Air blew across Hebra once again.
  The skies cleared, and blooming
  flowers rose from the ground.
  The god had given them the blessing
  of wind.
  
  This ark that saved the village from
  catastrophe came to be known as the
  Stormwind Ark.
  So ends the story of the Stormwind Ark
  that saved the village long ago.

  Believing no ordinary being could fall
  from the heavens, the villagers called this
  figure a god.
  And the god stood atop a hill day after
  day, longing to return home to their
  island in the heavens.
  The villagers, forgetting their own
  troubles, tried to carry the god
  home on their proud wings.
  Yet who could say how far it might be,
  the place this god came from?
  
  The Rito took flight in turn, each hoping
  to reach that place above the clouds...
  Alas, none had wings strong enough.
Talk0014: |
  One day, the winds that ought to blow
  in Rito Village ceased. Then the heavens
  grew stagnant, and the earth fell to ruin.
  The villagers looked skyward for
  a solution.
  
  They saw a figure pierce through the
  unmoving gray clouds and descend
  swiftly toward them.

  Seeing this, the god told the leader of the
  village that returning to the heavens was
  possible if the Rito gathered materials.
  Their spirits high, the villagers set about
  doing so.
  
  The god nodded upon seeing the tall pile
  of materials. This, they understood, would
  be enough.
Talk0016: |
  The god poured a strange power into
  the pile, and several small boats were
  assembled.
  Cautiously, the villagers boarded.
  The small vessels began floating up
  into the air.
  With the god leading them, the boats
  rose higher and higher, soon passing
  through the thick clouds.
  The vastness of the heavens took the
  villagers' breath away. Floating islands
  dotted a clear blue sky.
  The villagers rejoiced songfully and then,
  with reluctance, returned to earth.
