  Someday I hope I can make the trip east
  to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tarrey Town <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and order a dream home
  of my own.

  All I know is that Hudson Construction
  started a new service where they build
  them for you.
  If you want to learn more, you should just
  find them in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tarrey Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. That's to the
  east of this stable.
  Here's hoping we both end up in dream
  homes of our own with amazing partners
  who smell good and like dogs.

  I told Papa to put up a picture of the Unity Bell for

  He's my father. Shouldn't he be doing his best to

  That's the Hudson Construction jingle.
  Hear it once, and you'll never be able to
  get it out of your head.
