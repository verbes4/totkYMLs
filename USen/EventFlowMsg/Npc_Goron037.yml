  Mind if I yammer at ya for a sec?
  
  I've heard things have gotten pretty
  bad in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  The workers aren't working, includin' my
  pals at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>YunoboCo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> who live to work!
  
  Do you know what's goin' on over there?
  I'm worried...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>As a traveler, I figured you might know
  something about whatever's happening
  in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron City<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  I heard that my pals at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>YunoboCo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  have shut down production and are
  sittin' on their haunches.
  Just what's goin' on?<5 Type='0'/>

  back in business!
  
  Which means I'd better hurry up and

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Careful, now. The ground is uneven, what
  with all the debris everywhere.
  
  If you wander around without payin'
  attention, you might end up fallin' down
  a hole...

  If ya look off that way, you can see

  But lately the mountain's been looking

  See, we Gorons are a friendly and

  But I'm told even my pals at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>YunoboCo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
