  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Fireproof gear is way out of my

  But it's basically free to catch a wild
  fireproof lizard to make it into a

  So I'm taking extra care and making sure
  my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>footsteps don't make noise <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so I go
  home with a good haul today.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Ideally, I'd root around their burrow <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>inside
  of the cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But without any fireproof gear, it's way

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, didn't see you there. I've got <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fireproof

  So, uh...did you need something?
  I'm kinda busy.
talk05: |

  Fireproof lizards?
talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Fireproof lizards are a key ingredient for
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fireproof elixirs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you see.
  
  Fireproof equipment is so pricey that
  I can't afford it, but fireproof lizards?
  They don't cost a thing.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It seems like their <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>burrow <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>inside the
  cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and that's where I'd like to get to.
  
  But the cave is sweltering hot. A Hylian
  like you or me wouldn't last long without 
  appropriate defenses.

  somewhere else.
  They're always on high alert, and they're

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I wish I had fireproof gear like you

  If you're wondering, I'm out here catching
  fireproof lizards so I can brew a<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> fireproof
  elixir <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>or two.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I've figured out that their <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>burrow <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>inside
  the cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so I want to get in there and get
  to work.
  Problem is, the cave is absolutely
  sweltering, and a Hylian like me
  wouldn't last long in there.

  lizards, please do me a favor and go
  catch elsewhere.
  These lizards are always on high alert and
  are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>really sensitive to footsteps<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so the
  less feet there are here, the better.
