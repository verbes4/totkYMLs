  disappeared suddenly in the depths
  beneath Hyrule Castle.
  On the other hand, she suddenly
  appeared near Zora's Domain and
  unleashed a monster upon us.
  The waters of truth have become murkier
  still,<5 Type='1'/> but from the Zora perspective,
  one thing is clear.

  mentioned on the stone slate that was
  restored? Hm... Indeed, I do know of it.
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mark of the king<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> refers to a Zora
  king's scale. One of my scales,
  in other words.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I have heard it called by the name you

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>If this particular scale of mine may prove

  If you speak in such a way without

  much reflection, I have come to a
  realization.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>I must truly be getting on in years to have
  allowed a mere monster to catch me

  Perhaps the time is nearing for me to pass
  the title of king on to Sidon.
