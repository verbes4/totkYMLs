  Time for gossip and news about the past
  and the future! Today's topic is...
  
  The Weird and Wonderful
  Spirit Koroks!
  
  At the moment the night is at its
  darkest, when even the trees have
  drifted into slumber...
  Actually, the time of day doesn't matter
  at all... Anyway...
  
  All throughout the world, you may spot
  these odd little spirit critters as you
  wander the land.
  They could be under a rock, or way out
  in the wilds, or even just in a suspicious
  nook that seems slightly not right...
  Real eerie, huh?

  Hey there! Traysi here, representing the
  rumor-lovin' sisters! Have you heard
  gossip from your family members?
  Here's my current favorite:
  
  
  Dragons Actually Exist!
  
  
  "No way! That simply can't be true!"
  Is that what you're thinking right now?
  I used to think that too...
  But then I traveled to Lanayru, Akkala,
  and Faron, and I heard some real
  eyewitness accounts!
  Of course, these were scoops from
  children, but still...
  
  Children are pure of heart, meaning they
  would never lie! I have total confidence
  in my sources.

  Traysi here, bringing you the latest news
  and gossip from morning to night!
  
  Glowing Blue Bunny
  
  
  A looong time ago, there was a
  skilled hunter.
  
  On the way back from a hunt, he saw a
  light moving in the darkness.
  
  Without hesitation, he fired an arrow
  toward it, and where it had been he
  found a bunch of rupees.
  From that day forward, whenever he saw
  a similar light, he would fire an arrow
  at it.
  He always found rupees where his target
  had been, and he grew quite rich.
  
  Or so the story goes... I bet you think
  this is just a myth, right?
  
  Then what do you say about all the
  people who claim to have seen a glowing
  blue bunny in the forest lately?
  You probably say, "Oh, Traysi, thank you
  for writing volume 6!" Sound about right?
  
  You should say that, because the blue
  bunny is the light the hunter saw!
  
  Finding it means finding lots and lots of
  rupees! I can't endorse this bit of gossip
  enough!
  Traysi's Recommendation: ★★★★★
  
  
  Wait, I don't know how to use a bow and
  arrow... That really puts a damper on
  things.

  This is Traysi! I have a taste for
  the rumors of worlds long gone and
  worlds yet to come!
  Everyone gossiping in the present
  world? Here's my favorite bit of the
  latest news...
  The Secret of the Royal Family
  of Hyrule
  
  I heard a rumor that there's something to
  be found inside Hyrule Castle...
  
  And that something is a secret room of
  Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, the last
  king of Hyrule!
  There's also supposedly a laboratory that
  belonged to his daughter, Princess
  Zelda. A double discovery!
  I bet there are all kinds of amazing
  royal-family secrets hidden in those
  rooms just waiting to be revealed!
  "Secrets of the Royal Family Uncovered!"
  That headline alone would keep food on
  the table for months!
  But there's no way I'm going anywhere
  near a place as dangerous as Hyrule
  Castle. No way!
  Don't let that scare you though...
  Traysi's Recommendation: ★★★★★

  Who loves gossip more than a solid
  three meals a day? Traysi, of course!
  And anyone else reading this, I'm sure!
  Today's top gossip spot is...
  
  
  The Lover's Pond!
  
  
  Legend says that those who find this
  pond are sure to also find their true love!
  Sounds worthwhile to me!
  Traysi's Recommendation: ★★★★★

  Return to the first rumor.

  Greetings from Traysi—your source for
  the best gossip and news!
  
  Have you been hearing any good stories
  on your travels? I've got a great one for
  you today!
  "The Sword That Seals the Darkness."
  
  
  The only one who can wield this
  sword carries the blood of the hero
  in their veins.
  That's what they say about this special
  blade! Rumor has it the blade has been
  hidden away in a forest somewhere...
  I have to admit that this rumor really has
  me interested, but sometimes you have
  to face reality.
  My reality is... There isn't any hero in my
  bloodline, so this sword would just be a
  big paperweight to me...
  Traysi's Recommendation: ★☆☆☆☆
