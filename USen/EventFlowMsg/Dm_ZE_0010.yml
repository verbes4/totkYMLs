  It's...something only I can do.
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_005_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_007_b: |
  How is...the Master Sword...
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_010_aaac: |
  I know why I am here.
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_010_aabc: |
  We will finally stop him.
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_014_b: |
  You must find me.
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_001_c: |
  We managed to restrain him somehow...

Dm_ZE_0010_Text_006_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_007_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_008_c: |
  You traveled through time to find me and recover
  your strength.
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_009_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_012_c: |
  Link...
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_006_bb: |
  The Master Sword...
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_009_d: |
  Zelda... I believe there is a reason you were sent
  to us. It has to mean something.

  "To become an immortal dragon is to lose oneself."
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_010_aae: |
  I'll be...forever changed.
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_010_aaf: |
  
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_008_bb: |
  You're telling me...that Link is safe?
Dm_ZE_0010_Text_002_ab: |
  But, Link... I am not sure you'll be able to stop him.
