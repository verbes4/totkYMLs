  down to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten Temple<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>How did it end up down there, anyway?
  
  
  Maybe they built it at ground level, but
  after a seismic shift, it got swallowed up
  into the earth.
  Or could it be <5 Type='0'/>they put it in down there
  on purpose to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hide something important<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...<5 Type='1'/>
  Hmmm.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That canyon alongside the road is called
  Tanagar Canyon.
  
  And at one end of it, there's a ruin known
  as the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten Temple<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  I'm thinking about heading down there
  to investigate.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But the canyon...<5 Type='1'/>it's so deep. How am
  I going to get down?

  There's an amazing ruin at the bottom
