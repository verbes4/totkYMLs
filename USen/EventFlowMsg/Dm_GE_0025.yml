  He was our chief...before he changed. His obsession
  with power transformed him into a monster.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_015_c: |
  Another of the six sages—the Sage of Time.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_004_b: |
  We faced the Demon King but only after Rauru gave
  us the means to fight the monster.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_015_d: |
  Some time later...
Dm_GE_0025_Text_017_c: |
  The magic restraining the Demon King will eventually
  be undone.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_006_b: |
  I—the Sage of Lightning—fought by my fellow sages
  in battle with my own secret stone.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_015_e: |
  Another of the six sages—the Sage of Time—came to
  visit me, and she set the Gerudo on our destined path.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_019_c: |
  So please... He will need your assistance. Lend him
  your power... The Gerudo's control of lightning!
Dm_GE_0025_Text_008_b: |
  He endured our strongest attacks. Even the lightning
  strikes I called down...
Dm_GE_0025_Text_021_c: |
  We wish nothing more than to eliminate the
  Demon King.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_023_b: |
  I swear to you that when the Demon King returns,
  the Gerudo Sage of Lightning will awaken once more.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_010_c: |
  King Rauru knew we had lost the battle against the
  Demon King.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_012_b: |
  That was the Imprisoning War...
Dm_GE_0025_Text_001_b: |
  A great evil, the Demon King, emerged. He attacked
  the innocent and sought the destruction of Hyrule.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_014_c: |
  The rest of us survived that historic battle. Not long
  after, a visitor came to me. And she set the Gerudo on
  our destined path.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_003_b: |
  Rauru—the first king of Hyrule—and six warriors rose
  to oppose him. I'm proud to have been one of them.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_005_b: |
  Secret stones... Artifacts that amplified the abilities of
  those who carried them.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_018_c: |
  When that time comes, you must help Link. He is a
  noble swordsman who will fight that monster.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_005_c: |
  We faced the Demon King but only after Rauru gave
  us the secret stones.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_007_b: |
  But we were no match for his overwhelming power.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_005_d: |
  Artifacts that amplified the abilities of
  those who carried them.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_020_b: |
  The path of the Gerudo was clear at that moment...
Dm_GE_0025_Text_022_b: |
  We are responsible for his very existence in this
  world, and for that we must make amends.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_011_b: |
  He made the ultimate sacrifice, to imprison
  the Demon King... To seal him away.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_024_b: |
  The Gerudo sage and her people will fight alongside
  your swordsman.
Dm_GE_0025_Text_000_b: |
  Long, long ago...when the kingdom of Hyrule was
  still young...
