  The Demon King is responsible for sending the
  monster that caused the sand shroud.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_000_b: |
  Riju...beloved daughter of the Gerudo.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_007_b: |
  But the monster's true purpose was to prevent you
  from obtaining that stone—my secret stone.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_001_b: |
  I know that voice...
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_008_b: |
  Demon King? Secret stone?
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_002_b: |
  You are the one who's been talking all this time.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_009_b: |
  Don't worry. You will understand soon enough.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_010_c: |
  Let me tell you of events in our distant past.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_012_b: |
  The events that shaped our people's destiny—during
  the Imprisoning War.

DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_003_c: |
  Yes. Your ancestor from a time long past...
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_004_b: |
  I was a Gerudo warrior who served the first king of
  Hyrule and a sage who called down lightning.
  Just as you can.
DmT_GE_StoneMind_Text_005_b: |
  I've seen you brandish the power you have in defense
  of our people... I would expect nothing less from my
  descendant. You are the pride of the Gerudo.
