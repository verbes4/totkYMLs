  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Ahhh... Investigating ruins is not an easy
  job, that's for sure.
  
  I used to get through the days by looking
  forward to Fenlin's cooking...
  
  But now she's gone off to Gerudo Town,
  so I can't even do that!
  
  She should return at some point, but it's
  been a while since she left... <5 Type='1'/>I really do
  miss her cooking.
talk_Day_01_2: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I wonder when Fenlin will get back.
  
  
  Maybe there's some reason she can't
  leave Gerudo Town right now?
  
  I hope she returns soon though. Without
  her cooking, I'm really feeling the wear
  and tear of investigating.

  a good rainstorm makes it possible to get
  work done.
  It's time to investigate our very
  hearts out!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>Or it would be, but now that everything is
  soaked, it's a bit harder to spot details...

  where you're walking.
talk_Evening_Rain_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Are you here to help us with our
  investigation of these ruins? Sadly, we
  can't really work right now...
  The temperatures are pretty extreme
  around here, you see.
  
  The nights are so cold that, without a
  fire, you'd freeze solid! And with the rain
  on top of that...
  Well, we just can't get any work done
  safely right now.
talk_Day_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Are you here to help us with our

  Thanks to the extreme temperatures
  around here, we're only able to work a
  little bit at a time.
  The days are so hot that you'll pass out
  quick if you're not in the shade. And the
  nights... <5 Type='0'/>Just so, so cold...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Really, the only thing to look forward to is
  Fenlin's cooking.
  
  Her meals fill me up with enough energy
  to forget about the temperature! <5 Type='1'/>It must
  be some kind of secret recipe.
talk_Evening_Rain_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Looks like I might as well give up on
  furthering the investigation today. <5 Type='0'/>Time to
  prep for tomorrow and get some sleep.
talk_Midnight: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='08004500610073006500'/>Make sure you rest up so your mind and
  body are ready for whatever the next
  day might hold.
  The temperature will get you if you
  aren't careful...

  out in this rain?
talk_Day_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>So hot... If not for the shade, I'd pass
  out from this heat. <5 Type='1'/>Ugh.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>If only it would rain... Being soaked would
  keep us cool while we investigate
  these ruins.
  Hmph. <5 Type='1'/>I could go for some of Fenlin's
  cooking right now.
