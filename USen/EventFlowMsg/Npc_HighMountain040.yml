  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Shield surfing is kind of like sledding,
  except you're standing on a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shield <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>instead
  of sitting on a sled. It's a rush!
  Best of all, you can surf over snowy
  patches that aren't traversable by foot.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Hmmm...<5 Type='0'/> You do want to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>build up
  momentum <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>before you kick off.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Personally, I like to get a running start
  or surf down a hill.

  now that there aren't any more monsters
  to worry about.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You know, I wonder if the stories of the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>legendary shield surfer <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>are true.<0 Type='4'/>I know nothing about them, except that
  they're rumored to be in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hebra
  Mountains <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>up north. Might be dangerous.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You did it! Thanks for saving our
  hides. Again.<0 Type='4'/>It was cold, so we decided to make <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>spicy
  elixir<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. But by the time it was ready, the
  monsters were everywhere again.
  I know! Why don't you take it?
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's important to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>have some momentum<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  before you kick off. <5 Type='0'/>It's hard to explain
  until you get the trick to it.<0 Type='4'/>I find it helps to get a running start or surf
  down a hill.
