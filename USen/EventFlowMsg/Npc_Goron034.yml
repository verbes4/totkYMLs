  Rock roast?
Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Yeah, you know... The team that digs up
  ore round here and sells it and stuff.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Big Bro was always feeling proud about
  the growth in Goron City, saying it's all
  thanks to YunoboCo.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But ever since they started selling
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>marbled rock roast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, the whole city's
  been feeling weird...

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>YunoboCo<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> sells now. They're like...
  everywhere!
  You can find them in the caves around
  here—kinda all over the place lately.
  Everyone says they're SUPER tasty...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But they're so hard and crunchy that us
  kids and elders can't eat them—our teeth
  can't handle that crunch...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Not even his eyes look the same anymore.
  It's like he was never my Big Bro at all...

  again too!
  
  Back to his big dream of eating a lava
  feast of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rock roast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Lava feast!
  
  
  I have no idea what that even means,
  but it's Big Bro's dream, so I want it
  to happen!
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's the tastiest rock! Every Goron
  everywhere loves it!<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You used to be able to get it all over <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>in
  the caves around here<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But Big Bro says that it's tricky to get to
  where it's located these days.
  
  So that's why he wants to strike it big and
  find whole bunches of it!
