  Victory will be ours!

  Here come my fists!

  This can't be happening...

  Forged in Gerudo, it is a thing of beauty.
  Voe are always quite impressed.

  Incredible!
  
  I can't thank you enough. I guess the rest
  is up to us now.

  Just like in practice...

  totally flummoxed by the collapsed bridge.
  
  Then you come swooping in and wipe out
  every last monster. All by yourself too!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're thinking about heading in there
  alone in the dead of night... Yeah, I'm
  not sure that sounds like a good idea.

  might be this morning, I'm not sure it's
  a good idea to head in there alone.
