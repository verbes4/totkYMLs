  Victory will be ours!
Near1022: |
  Here come my fists!
Near1017: |
  This can't be happening...

  They're no match for us!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0200'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068004c00'/>My spear technique is worth observing.
  Forged in Gerudo, it is a thing of beauty.
  Voe are always quite impressed.

  Incredible!
  
  I can't thank you enough. I guess the rest
  is up to us now.
Near1018: |
  I'm taking you down!

  Just like in practice...

  totally flummoxed by the collapsed bridge.
  
  Then you come swooping in and wipe out
  every last monster. All by yourself too!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're thinking about heading in there
  alone in the dead of night... Yeah, I'm
  not sure that sounds like a good idea.

  might be this morning, I'm not sure it's
  a good idea to head in there alone.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>We were just on our way to rough up
  those monsters over there.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>But the bridge to the ship collapsed,
  so we don't have a way to board it.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>We can give those monsters a real
  whoopin' if we can just <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>get that
