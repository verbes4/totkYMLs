  It won't give an inch...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0041006e00670072007900'/>How did something this huge just appear
  here out of nowhere?
near0001: |
  How many more are there?
near0002: |
  All's well, shroud aside.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Those voe from the caravan squad are
  spirited, but that's about all they have
  going for them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If only they had true strength like you.
  
  
  Maybe then, perhaps, Captain Ripp
  wouldn't have had to fire them.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0041006e00670072007900'/>I think this is stone, but no matter what I
  do, I can't put a dent in it!

  Can't let my guard down...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0200'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0041006e00670072007900'/>No matter how many I strike down, more
  keep coming... It's as if we're standing
  atop a hive!
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>My heart flutters, even now, to think of
  the courage you displayed in that battle.
  
  It is reassuring to see that there is at
  least one capable Hylian voe.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>You are quite unlike those members of
  the caravan squad.
  
  They were helping us with our guard
  duties up until Captain Ripp fired them.
talk0003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, now that the sand shroud is gone
  and our forces are restored, we shouldn't
  need to rely on outsiders' help anymore.
