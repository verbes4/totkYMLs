  An election?
Talk_0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah, some folks in the village are going
  ahead with preparations for the elections
  for the next mayor.<0 Type='4'/>Things between Cece and Reede got
  pretty heated, I guess.<0 Type='4'/>Not that I much care who's mayor around
  this place.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Although, here's a thought. What if I was
  mayor? <5 Type='0'/>I bet things would turn around
  for me then, yes, sir.

  How gauche.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>We had that election to decide who's
  gonna be the next village mayor.<0 Type='4'/>Well, sort of. In the end, Cece withdrew
  from the race, so Reede's gonna keep
  being mayor by default.<0 Type='4'/>They both care a little too much about
  what happens to the village, if you
  ask me.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Maybe I should've thrown my hat in.<5 Type='0'/>
  I bet things would turn around for me

  I gotta hold fast and protect Ms. Ivee.
Talk_0018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>See you. And if you're thinking of making
  a move on the ladies, do it someplace
  else, will ya?

  That's a Cece exclusive!
Talk_0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It's gotta be tough out there what with
  the Upheaval. Stuff falling out of the sky,
  monster attacks left and right...<0 Type='4'/>Not here though. Yours truly keeps
  watch over the entrance, day and night,
  to make sure of it.

  Keeping watch?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Thanks to the Cece brand, we see more
  people coming and going from the village.<0 Type='4'/>I'm just checking out the beauties—<5 Type='1'/>
  Uh, I mean tourists— Wait, I mean
  suspicious characters! Yeah, that's it!<0 Type='4'/>Although...<5 Type='0'/>now that you brought up
  beauties, no one else holds a candle
  to Ms. Ivee.<0 Type='4'/>Then again, <5 Type='0'/>the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>princess <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of Hyrule Castle
  who used to stay in the house to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>south <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of the village? <5 Type='0'/>She was all right.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>Still didn't hold a candle to
