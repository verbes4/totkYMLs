  to worry that it might just be me.
Talk_18: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Whaâ€” Hey! Please don't touch that. It
  wasn't exactly easy to get my hands on.
Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The forest ahead is the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lost Woods<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and
  it's always been...pretty weird. If you got
  lost, you'd wind up back at the entrance!
  But now, the fog in there's gotten even
  thicker. Take two steps into the forest,
  and it'll spit you right out.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If you made your way to those sky islands,
  you might just be able to approach that
  strange ruin from above.
  I've half a mind to take a balloon up there
  myself, but the louder half is screaming,
  "No! Nooo!" so it might take me a while.

  up ahead!
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh, are you an adventurer too? You feel
  the vibes, right? The strange vibes in the
  air all around here?

  into those woods, but now you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>can't
  progress at all<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  listen close, friend, I've got something
  good to share.<0 Type='4'/>Behold!
Talk_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Thing is, no matter how you try, you'll get
  enveloped in fog and expelled from the
  forest before you can get close.

  It's just so weird...
Talk_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lost Woods<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> up ahead have always
  been pretty weird, but they've gotten
  even weirder of late.
  Before, you could at least walk a ways
  into the woods, but now <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>you can't
  progress at all<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Talk_13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You see it? That structure with the whole
  swirling-green situation going on?
  
  They've been showing up everywhere.
  Gets your adventurer's heart pumping for
  some exploration, huh?
0000: |
  The...vibes?
Talk_15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But while I was investigating, I noticed
  something interesting.<0 Type='4'/>Look, up in the sky!
0001: |
  I feel the vibes.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>You see those floating islands?

Talk_17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I bet you could get a great view looking
  down from up there.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>I'd take a balloon up there myself, but...
