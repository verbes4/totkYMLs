  There are some in there, but the path to

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>The caves here have lava in them, so <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>it's
  burning hot inside<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You'll turn to dust
  unless you're a Goron.
  For Hylians like us, we have to do
  something extra to protect ourselves.
  
  Mixing <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fireproof lizards <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>with<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> monster parts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to make fireproof elixirs, for example.
  
  I can't help out with the ingredients, but
  if you have them, feel free to use that pot
  over there to make what you need.

  Burned to a crisp?
Talk_08: |
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>The caves around here still spew lava.
  Which means they're boiling hotâ€”you get
  burned up pretty quick once inside them.
  Anytime I go inside one of these caves,
  I make sure I'm carrying a fireproof elixir.
  
  You can whip one up real quick combining
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fireproof lizard <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster parts <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in
  a pot.
