  appointed swordsman!
  
  He's always getting in our way every
  chance he gets. The guy's a real pain.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>But not for long. The Yiga is tightening its
  net all over Hyrule. <5 Type='0'/>I'm sure we'll hear
  news of his death any day now.
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c004c0061007500670068005300'/>Heh heh...<5 Type='0'/> He'll never expect that we're
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>disguising ourselves as trees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to ambush
  him. He's done for!

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Link <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>right away...
  
  Maybe I'll make him lug all this stuff to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Depths <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and back for me... Work him
  till he kicks the bucket. That'll show him!

  Good luck with that...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>The only way Link could ever beat Master
  Kohga is with a cowardly surprise attack!<0 Type='4'/>If that's how he does things, we'll pay him
  with a surprise attack of our own.

  I go back and forth between the Depths

  Between this, that, and the other thing,
  all of this is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Link<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>'s fault!
