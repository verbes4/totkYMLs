  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, it's you! You have been diligent in
  your training, I hope?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>No matter how hard I try, I cannot keep
  up with my constantly punching friends
  on the cliff over there.
  So I've taken it upon myself to stand
  guard here.<5 Type='0'/> It's all I'm good for, anyway...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0600530061006400'/>I once thought that none could best me
  in matters of endurance.<0 Type='4'/>But between you defeating me twice over
  and my friends on the cliff, I have learned
  how vast the world truly is.
  Perhaps this is a sign that I must redouble
  my training efforts...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, you again! I trust you've been keeping
  up with your training?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>My friends continue to throw punches
  up on that cliff, undeterred by the rain...<0 Type='4'/>Meanwhile, my limited punching capacity
  has consigned me to guard duty.
  Ugh, I'm so ashamed of myself...

  to endure...guard duty.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ah, hello again, my enduring friend! It's
  been some time since our fateful match.<0 Type='4'/>In the time since, I have been traveling
  from place to place in the hopes that I
  may reforge myself.
  That's when I met some like-minded
  folksâ€”the two throwing punches
  on the cliff over there.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Though it pains me to say it, I...cannot
  keep up with them.<0 Type='4'/>Day or night, rain or shine, nothing stops
  their endless barrage of punches.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But that just means I have room yet to
  grow! There's always someone better out
  there, so I must never stop training!

  I still can't keep up...
