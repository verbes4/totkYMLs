  Yeesh, do you have any idea how

  Purah told me everything!

  All right, then. Let's see it.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Looks like you've captured it well. I'm

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>Purah and I worked together on the
  design, but I'm the one who put it
  together, you know.
  We should've called it the Robbie Pad,
  technically speaking.
Talk_50: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>OK, you'll want to head straight out of
  Lookout Landing's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southern gate<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You'll
  find the chasm Goggles used just outside.
  I don't know too much about how your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>works...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c0061007500670068004c005f0030003000'/>But I'm counting on you to bring me that
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Oh, and please look after <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goggles<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  for me!
Talk_66: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Hey, you! Is it true you've got the
  Purah Pad?
Talk_51: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Josha, come on now...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  Tell you what. I'll go down there myself
  and see if I can't find anything about the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>figure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>slate<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  more info on it, then it should help us
  better understand <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
Talk_52: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>We'll start by looking for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>anything down
  there that resembles the figure on
  the slate<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Assuming we find what we're looking for,
  we'll use your Purah Pad's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to take
  a picture of it for Josha.<5 Type='1'/> A perfect plan!
Talk_68: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But Goggles here says it's too dangerous,
  and he won't let me go.
Talk_53: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>All right! Get that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of yours ready. 
  It's time to put it to work.
Talk_69: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, it's you!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>You know, that Purah Pad of yours may
  seem perfect... <5 Type='0'/>But it could be even
  more perfect!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I'll need to head back to the lab when
  Josha's got <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Depths investigation<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  sorted out...
Talk_54: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You can find the chasm that Goggles
  headed for by going straight out of
  Lookout Landing's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southern gate<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  I think he plans to enter <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  from there.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Sorry I can't tell you anything about how
  that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> works. I just know it captures
  images that look like the real thing!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>So if you find a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>figure <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>down there that
  looks like the one I showed you, get a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of it for me, please!
Talk_55: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What?!
  
  
  Look at how bright that thing got!
  That light down in this dark is
  downright refreshing.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Hm...<5 Type='1'/> In fact, it's so luminous, it's
  almost like...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Like we're on the surface!
  
  
  Just standing near it makes <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>me feel so
  much better<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. How strange.<5 Type='1'/>
Talk_40: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I can barely make it out, but this
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>statue <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>here...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>It's standing tall on two legs, one arm
  raised high...
  
  It looks an awful lot like the figure Josha
  showed us on that piece of slate, don't
  you think?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0901'/><4 Type='0' Data='100041006e006700720079005f0030003000'/>No way, no how! You can't do that!
  
  
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>The Depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are far too vast for you to
  explore on your own. And we've only
  barely begun to look into them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'd love to go gallivanting around down
  there too—who knows what wonders
  are at the bottom of those chasms!
  <4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>But no matter how wondrous they may be,
  it's far too dangerous for you.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0901'/>I'm not about to allow our young prodigy
  to go wandering around somewhere so
  unknown, so foul!
  If anything were to happen to Purah's
  favorite student, it'd be the end for me!<5 Type='0'/>
  The END!
Talk_41: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>That's right! I forgot you hadn't used
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> when we last spoke.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Very curious indeed, given it's one of
  the Purah Pad's basic features.
  
  Hmm...<5 Type='0'/> Give me that Purah Pad for a
  second, all right?
Talk_57: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>And Link will join me!
