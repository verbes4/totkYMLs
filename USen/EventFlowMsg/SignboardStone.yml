  Deep beneath this land, our mighty first
  ruler imprisoned the Demon King.<0 Type='4'/>To ensure the king's magic would hold,
  we erected a castle here to protect
  this sacred site.<0 Type='4'/>Without the castle in place, the site may
  be disturbed, allowing the Demon King's
  hatred and rage to be revived.<0 Type='4'/>The preservation of this castle is therefore
  tied to the prosperity of the kingdom.<0 Type='4'/>May it watch over an eternal peace.

  Long ago, a monstrosity of the sands
  attacked Gerudo Town. Its war cry rang
  out over the dunes like a raging demon.<0 Type='4'/>We seven heroines of the Gerudo—the
  most stalwart, chosen vai—surged forth
  to engage it.<0 Type='4'/>Yet this monstrosity tossed us about like
  the tumbling weeds. We feared that the
  proud Gerudo would be extinguished.<0 Type='4'/>And then...a hero appeared from afar.
  He marshaled the seven heroines,
  counseling us to combine our strengths.<0 Type='4'/>The strength upon strength of we seven
  routed the monstrosity. We named our
  benefactor, "the guiding light of Gerudo."<0 Type='4'/>Yet though we had naught but the highest
  praise for him, he was refused entry into
  Gerudo Town.<0 Type='4'/>'Twas Gerudo law that all those like him
  were barred.<0 Type='4'/>How hollow our gratitude and praise
  must have rung in this hero's ears!<0 Type='4'/>Thus was the link between his people and
  the Gerudo severed.<0 Type='4'/>Though we never bequeathed it to him,
  the gift into which our feelings are bound
  is enshrined at this sanctuary.
