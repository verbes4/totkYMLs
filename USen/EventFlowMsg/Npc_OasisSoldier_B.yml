  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hm? You're going to fight the Gibdos
  with us?<5 Type='1'/>
  
  You know that regular weapons aren't
  going to be enough, right?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Normally I'd be happy to share our
  materials with you, but we're running a
  little low at the moment.
  We only have three <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Electric Lizalfos horns<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  left, for example.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I'm sorry, but do you think you could
  prepare your own weapons?
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/>Nothing will get past me! Lady Riju is safe
  so long as I'm here!
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>We can't let our guard down so long as
  this sand shroud is around.
  
  But we defeated a significant number of
  Gibdos. I doubt they'll be able to mount
  another attack anytime soon.
  I'm taking advantage of this breather to
  keep my weapon in tip-top shape.
Talk13: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Not only did we overcome the enemy but
  we didn't lose any of the units!
  
  I am...hesitant to admit it, but our success
  was thanks to your support. I'd be foolish
  to deny that. Sarqso.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Things have improved a lot lately. The
  sand shroud has cleared up, the town
  finally feels at peace...
  So why does it seem like a fire has been
  lit under Babi?
  
  She's been training nonstop since the
  battle, and keeps saying things like "that
  voe trained hard to become so strong..."
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I've been polishing this spear and trying
  to avoid making eye contactâ€”I don't want
  to get dragged into her training.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>But my spear couldn't get much cleaner.
  The desert sun is making it sparkle at
  this point...
