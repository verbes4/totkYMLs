  <4 Type='0' Data='1800540075006c00690041006e006700720079005f0030003000'/>Well, maybe I would if you didn't treat me
  like a hatchling all the time!
Dm_RT_0040_014: |
  Still, every now and then, you get reports
  among the Rito of a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>flying ship<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Combine that with the blizzard caused
  by this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and it seems less
  far-fetched.
Dm_RT_0040_024: |
  You see the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>two bonfires<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> out that way?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>As long as you still think you can take on
  the world by yourself, you'll always be my
  little chick.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>My husband hasn't been able to leave
  the village much since becoming the
  village elder.

  <4 Type='0' Data='1600540075006c00690048006f0077006c005f0030003000'/>What, you think I can't? I'm already
  fully-fledged, you know!<0 Type='4'/>You'll change your tune when I ace
  today's scouting trip!

  He mentioned a song?

  <4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>Even if the Song of the Stormwind Ark is
  just a children's rhyme, I suspect that
  there is something lurking high in the sky.<0 Type='4'/>But the air is so turbulent now that no
  Rito can fly close enough to look into it.<0 Type='4'/>This is why I say we need to make careful
  preparations to find the truth, but Tulin...<0 Type='4'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>He thinks we cling to that song out
  of cowardice.

  even Hyrule Castle is safe...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>We Rito would ordinarily love to lend our
  strength to your search.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>But this abnormal blizzard shows no sign
  of stopping, and food has grown scarce.<0 Type='4'/>All the adults I could spare are already
  out investigating the blizzard or
  scavenging for food.
Dm_RT_0040_017: |
  You all can keep wasting your time
  treating the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Song of the Stormwind Ark<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  like it's real, but not me!
Dm_RT_0040_027: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0201'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>Unbelievable.

  <4 Type='0' Data='1800530075007200700072006900730065004d005f0030003100'/>Listen, youâ€”

  even Hyrule Castle is safe...<0 Type='4'/>If Princess Zelda's disappearance and the
  strange phenomena around the world are
  related somehow... Hm.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>We Rito would ordinarily love to

  researching the blizzard or scavenging
  for food.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I wish there was something I could do...
Dm_RT_0040_010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Tulin wants me to let him go find <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>what's<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>causing the blizzard<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and he's having

  You should try asking <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Harth<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>My friend Harth has many sources of
  information, so he might already have
  a lead about Princess Zelda.

  It's good to see you doing well.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>It's very nice to see you again.

  sort of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, the village was saved
  thanks to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a great flying ship<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Or so claims the song that's been passed
  down through generations.

  to try visiting him.

  He's grown taller, though perhaps not
  yet grown up.
Dm_RT_0040_013: |
  <4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>It's a song for children, mind you. Few
  adults still parrot it as if it were true.
Dm_RT_0040_023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003000'/>But these are Rito matters. You came for
  some purpose, yes?
