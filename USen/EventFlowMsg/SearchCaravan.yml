  another person down here.
  
  Fell down a sinkhole, did you?<5 Type='0'/> So did I,
  my guy!
  
  My name's Ponthos. I'm a member of a
  caravan squad.
  
  Or I was before monsters attacked the
  oasis, and I ditched my friends and ran.
  That's how I wound up down here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003000'/>I've looked all over the place, but I still

  You and me might be down here for a

  Please be safe...

  But I think I caught a glimpse of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ponthos<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  running out through the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>west entrance<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
near0001: |
  I messed up...
talk0030: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I know someone in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is on the
  lookout for stuff like this, so I was going
  to see if they could appraise it.
  But I'll let you have it, my guy!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>It's the rarest thing I've got, and it's all
  yours. Take good care of it for me!
near0003: |
  I'm so glad you're safe!
talk0032: |
  The name's Ponthos.<5 Type='1'/> I'm a member of the
  caravan squad. Or at least I was...<0 Type='4'/>When the oasis we were guarding was
  attacked by monsters, I ditched my pals
  and ran...<5 Type='0'/>straight into a sinkhole.
talk0033: |
  Uh...<5 Type='1'/> Ahem.<5 Type='1'/>
0000: |
  Sinkhole?
talk0020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You must have seen one by now! The
  places in the desert where the flow of
  sand gets all swirly, like a whirlpool?
  One false step into one of those and it'll
  suck you right in. They're a constant
  worry to travelers around here.
  Rumor has it that there are actually <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>caves<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  hidden under those sinkholes...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>I'm not about to investigate though.
  Those things are scary.

  that sinkhole?<5 Type='1'/> And Ponthos went and got
  himself stuck down there?
  How are we supposed to get him out?
  Those sinkholes are so dangerous—can
  we even attempt a rescue mission?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Well...<5 Type='1'/>I suppose I should just be grateful
  that Ponthos is relatively safe. I'll take
  what good news I can get!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Thank you for letting me know!

  Well, so long!
talk0021: |
  <FontSize Value='80'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Kinda makes me wonder though... Could there really

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>Oh, hello, young man! Have you come to

talk0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If we get lost in the desert, our squad's
  rule is to wait for rescue in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>a place that
  stands out<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—like near a tall building.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>But there are a lot of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sinkholes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in this

  with it... <5 Type='1'/>Please be OK, Ponthos.
talk0036: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I want to save Ponthos right away, of

  Oh, what to do...

talk0037: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Honestly, it's kinda just taking up space.
  I'd love for you to take it...<0 Type='4'/>But the guy it belongs to is kinda <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>stuck in
  a cave under a sinkhole <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>right now.<0 Type='4'/>If he ever comes back, though, you should
  definitely ask if he's willing to part with it.
talk0038: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>What?! Ponthos got swallowed up by

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Agh, now what?<5 Type='1'/> How are we supposed to

  I better hurry back—I'm sure my friends

  We're the caravan squad, a merchant

  Our friend Ponthos has, uh, disappeared.

  I thought Ponthos was with us the whole
