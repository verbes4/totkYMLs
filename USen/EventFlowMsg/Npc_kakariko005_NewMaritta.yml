  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I see. <5 Type='1'/>So Princess Zelda's whereabouts
  are still unknown, you say.
  
  Since that is the case, Link, I encourage
  you to go and speak with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Impa<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I could have sworn I saw you go up in our
  balloon with Lady Impa earlier.
  
  That must mean that you managed to fix it
  for us. Thank you, Link!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Where should we go next for our
  investigation?<0 Type='4'/>Hm, we really should pay a visit to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten Temple <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>at the bottom of the

  Lady Impa...
Talk1002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>She is right over there.
  
  
  I believe she may have some useful
  information that relates to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the search
  for Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>It seems we've finished investigating the
  geoglyph here.<0 Type='4'/>However, there are still many places left
  to investigate across the kingdom.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I wonder where we should go next...<0 Type='4'/>Should we venture to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Forgotten
  Temple <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>at the bottom of the gorge
  in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hebra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  Or perhaps we should visit the geoglyphs
  in another region...

  She's over there...

  Since that is the case, Link, then perhaps
  our geoglyph research will be of some
  use to you.

  She should be able to contribute to the
  search for Princess Zelda, but with our
  research balloon in its current state...
Talk1007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>At any rate, does Lady Impa intend to
  continue her pondering over there?
  
  I should really ask her to come into the
  stable about now so she doesn't wear
  herself out.
