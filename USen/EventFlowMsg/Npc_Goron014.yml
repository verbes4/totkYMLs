  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This is just what I heard from the elderly
  fella who's a regular at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron Hot
  Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Guy knows his stuff.
  He says Simmerstone is in a place called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gorko Tunnel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, which is farther south than
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron Hot Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But that area is expansive, so if you're
  going there, I recommend you ask him
  for specifics.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>There's an elderly fella at Goron Hot
  Springs who really knows his stuff when
  it comes to hot springs.
  He told me about a place called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Simmerstone Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that's
  apparently legendary.
  I can't decide whether to go to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron
  Hot Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Simmerstone Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  At this rate, the Southern Mine—no,

  Good ol' hot springs.

  Simmerstone Springs?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>The young Gorons are back to work, and
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Mine-Cart Land <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>was completed safely.
  
  I think it's about time I retire and tour
  some hot springs.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Suppose I'll start with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goron Hot Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  Actually, maybe I'll go farther than
  that. Maybe I'll take a peek at
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Simmerstone Springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
