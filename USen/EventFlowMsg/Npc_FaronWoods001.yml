  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003000'/>That's right. It was a stocky animal that
  was wider than a horse and had strange
  horns. But not like a cow's or goat's!
  Oh, and it had tusks that made the beast
  look like a little brute!

  the east. I rushed closer to get a good
  look, but it ran off by the time I got there.
  I'd never seen anything like it. I must say,
  the whole experience was shocking.
