  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>From new recruit to blademaster faster
  than anyone in Yiga history. Impressive.<0 Type='4'/>But don't expect any special treatment.
  Master Kohga's the only special one
  around here!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You the new guy they're all talking about?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You've got a reputation for mastering the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Earthwake technique<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> faster than anybody
  we've ever seen.
  Keep it up. The more you use that power,
  the greater Master Kohga's infamy grows.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Our number of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bases<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the Depths only

  We're still short on supplies of course,
  so we'll be counting on you to help keep

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You've got a reputation for being the
  chosen user of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lightning Helm<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Nobody else could handle that thing.
  Wear it everywhere you go and show off
  its power as much as you can to honor
  our great Master Kohga!
