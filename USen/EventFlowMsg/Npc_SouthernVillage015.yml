  their own.
  You'll be safe from the guards here, so
  feel free to take all the time you need to

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>That outfit... <5 Type='0'/>It would be best if the guards
  didn't see you dressed that way.
  
  But besides that...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>The desert may be a warm place, but I
  would really appreciate it if you'd wear
  a little bit more clothing, OK?
  But besides that...

  appear right before my eyes. Nearly made
  me jump out of my skin!
  I should thank you though. I had a crick
  in my back, but the shock of your arrival
  seems to have fixed it!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>My husband is a Hylian voe too. Imagine
  if he'd been the one suddenly appearing!
  But obviously he isn't allowed into town...
  Since it is customary for Gerudo to return
  to town at a certain age, our daughter
  and I moved back here...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>I warned my husband—several times—that
  voe were not allowed inside the town and
  were sometimes jailed, but...
  Well, he insisted on traveling with us all
  the way here, and I saw him eyeing the
  town walls when we parted ways.

  you'd better get out of town before any

  haven't found you. Normally they're pretty
  good at catching intruders...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0045006100730065005f0030003000'/>I won't turn you in, of course, but once
