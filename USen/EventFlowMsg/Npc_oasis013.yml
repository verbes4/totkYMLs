  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hey, voe. We Gerudo have a saying.
  
  
  "For young vai, speaking with a voe will
  only invite misfortune!"
  
  <4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Vai learn that at an early age, so even
  though you're allowed to be here, please
  leave the young ones be.

  <4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Besides, I learned that it's best to know

  Ms. Ashai talked about that in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>class<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
