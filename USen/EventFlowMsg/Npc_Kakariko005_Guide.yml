  Well then, Link...
  
  You may want to meet with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lady Impa<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>She's investigating the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>geoglyphs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that
  have appeared across the landâ€”a curious
  name for this strange phenomenon.
  Lady Impa believes that they're crucial
  to the search for Princess Zelda.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>She's traveling in one of those new
  balloon contraptions and should be at
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>New Serenne Stable <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>right now.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I'm in a hurry to meet with Lady Impa,
  but I can't go anywhere nearly as fast as
  she can in her balloon.
  Let's see... <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>New Serenne Stable <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is just a
  little to the northwest of central Hyrule.
  
  If you'll excuse me, I need to be on
  my way!
Talk03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Ah, Link! We meet again!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Have you found any clues as to where
  Princess Zelda might be?
  
  Lady Impa believes she has found a
  source of information that might help
  in the search for Princess Zelda.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'd suggest that you go meet with
  Lady Impa.
  
  She should be at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>New Serenne Stable <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in
  North Hyrule Plain.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>I'm trying to reach her myself, but I'm
  sorry to say that I'm so bad with
  directions, I haven't gotten there yet.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>I hope to get there soon though, so
  forgive me if I excuse myself!
