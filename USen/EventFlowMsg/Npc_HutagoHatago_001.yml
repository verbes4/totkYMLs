  edge of the sea <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeast <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of here, is a
  famous resort spot.
  And it's home to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule's finest sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  The moment the sun clears the horizon
  and lights the village is truly a must-see.
  They say it's best experienced from the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>summit of Tuft Mountain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>But I can't leave my job to go sightseeing
  any more than I can, well, climb a
  mountain. And it's so far away...

  I can practically feel the light of the
  sunrise warming up our stable!
  Right now, the whole world is in chaos
  because of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  
  But no matter how dark the night, it's
  always followed by the dawn. <5 Type='0'/>That's the
  feeling that will carry me through this.

  See for yourself.

BurnedWakka_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you're really that fixated on our garland,
  you should head to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and
  buy your own.
  Just head north. You can't miss it.
9002: |
  Gotta go.
Com_Photo_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I wish I had some sort of picture of
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule's finest sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. <5 Type='0'/>Then I could
  paint it for myself!
9003: |
  Sorry, no pictures here.
Com_Photo_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you have a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of Hyrule's finest
  sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, please show it to me!
Com_Photo_07: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Doesn't it look spectacular?<5 Type='0'/> It wasn't the
  easiest painting I've ever done, but what
  a view!
  If you can top that with another <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule's finest sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, I'm happy to copy
  and frame a new one.
  So if you're ever struck by the urge to
  replace the picture, don't be shy about
  showing me something new!
WakkaCharm: |
  Oh, we have one of those.
Com_Photo_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>There it is! Hyrule's best sunrise over
  Lurelin!<5 Type='0'/> What majesty!<5 Type='0'/> What breathtaking
  natural splendor!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>Thank you, Link. Thank you for bringing
  me such an amazing sight!
Com_Photo_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It makes me smile just thinking of seeing
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>that beautiful sunrise over Lurelin Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  from the summit of Tuft Mountain.
  I would love to paint that view for myself,
  but I'm afraid my job comes first...
9006: |
  Let's try something new.
9007: |
  I like it how it is.
Talk_0011: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The drawings at this stable have gotten
  out of hand, haven't they?
  
  I'm sorry about that. No matter how many
  times I scold them, those sons of mine
  just don't listen.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If you ask them, they'll tell you they saw
  some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>big footprints<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, the likes of which
  nobody has ever seen!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I swear, I'll never stop being surprised by
  the things my kids can imagine.

  It's pretty cute, right?
  
  A young girl in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> made it.
  
  I put it up hoping it might bring some calm
  to the travelers that visit this place.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>I've already had customers tell me that
  the sight of this painting lifts their spirits!
Talk_0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I can't give you ours, but if you really
  want a ring garland of your own...
  
  Then I recommend you buy one at
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, directly north of here.
Talk_0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, you just reminded me. Apparently a
  new species of animal called a "Dondon"
  has been discovered in Faron.
  This old world of ours is just full of
  surprises, isn't it?
Com_Photo_12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Anyway,<5 Type='0'/> did you have thoughts about
  that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of Hyrule's finest sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Com_FirstTime_Only01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Now for the fun part. Because this is your
  first time here at Dueling Peaks Stable...
Com_FirstTime_Only02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>In addition to celebrating your first use of
  Dueling Peaks Stable, we want to thank
  you for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>registering a horse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. So...
Com_Photo_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Quite the frame, isn't it?<5 Type='0'/> I want to fill it
  with an appropriately grand scene of
  natural splendor, but, well...
  Tell me, Link, do you know where to find
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule's most beautiful sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  
  At the edge of the sea <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeast <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of here
  is a small fishing village called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lurelin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  It has a reputation as a resort town.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>But its real claim to fame is the beautiful
  moment where the sun rises over the
  horizon and lights up the whole village!
  And they say the most breathtaking view
  of this sunrise is from the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>summit of
  Tuft Mountain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0500'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>I'd love to see that view myself, but it's
  so far away, and I can't just leave work...<5 Type='0'/>
  Nor can I climb mountains.
  If only I could see <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hyrule's finest sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,<5 Type='0'/>
  I'd paint my own picture of it and finally
  put that frame to use.
Com_FirstTime_Only03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Not only is this your first use of Dueling
  Peaks Stable but you've even <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lodged
  with us<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. That deserves a reward, so...

  finest sunrise<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
