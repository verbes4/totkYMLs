  for you.<5 Type='0'/> The place you're at is actually
  called South Akkala Stable.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Since we've always had so many sheep
  here, some visitors started calling us the
  "sheep stable."
  So I thought, why not embrace it?
  And I started taking extra good care
  of the sheep.

  But no complaints from me. I think they're
  just adorable!

  She <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wouldn't lay eggs <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>when she was
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>by herself<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so I made a point to spend

  I just wish she had a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>friend<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to keep
  her company.
