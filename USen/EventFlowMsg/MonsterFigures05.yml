Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Hear ye, hear ye! Come, look see!
  
  
  This is it...<5 Type='0'/>the most monstrous of all
  monsters! The King Gleeok!
  
  But do not fear, draw near! This is the

  monstrous royal up close. The only place!
Talk32: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>It is nothing short of astonishing! It has

  Now, give me your ears! All of them!
  
  I say again, this monster is the fearsome
  King Gleeok.
  
  Fire, ice, lightning...powers possessed by

  here is unique!
  It controls all THREE elements at the

  And while it looks like a beast from a book
  of stories, <5 Type='0'/>I warn you not to dream of
  meeting it in the flesh.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>If you were to come face-to-triple-face

  Remember please, reckless adventurers

  I want nothing more than to give it the

  It's everything I hoped it would be!
Talk12: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>If I had that picture, the sculpture would
  be son and done. But, well, it's up

Talk27: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I know it's a sculpture, of course. Still,
  even I'm surprised at how imposing
