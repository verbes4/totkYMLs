  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>If you need a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>guide to the roads<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> around
  here, I can let you know what's what.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Things have changed around here lately,
  haven't they? Even the towns
  are different.
  There's been a lot of changes around
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  in particular.
Talk_1020: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Do we protect the old or embrace
  the new?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> seem
  like they're at a major turning point.
0001: |
  Kakariko Village?
Talk_1030: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Kakariko Village is a Sheikah village
  to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  It used to be a quiet town. That all
  changed when <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strange, ring-shaped
  Zonai ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> fell from the sky.
  Now it's crowded with both researchers
  and tourists.
Talk_1050: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hateno Village is at the edge of Hyrule,
  far to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>east<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  It used to be known primarily for its <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>milk<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  and its <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>local produce<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Then, out of nowhere, a woman from the
  clothes shop became a famous designer.
  
  Now the town has become a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>center
  for fashion<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, of all things.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>If you're looking to do something special,
  I recommend visiting Dueling Peaks'
  stone statues.
  There's no road up to the summit, so it's
  no easy trek...
  
  But the view of Hyrule at the top is a
  true wonder.

  You tamed that thing?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a0048006100700070007900'/>If you're up for a hard climb, I recommend

Talk_1032: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>And that's not the half of it! Apparently
  that ruin crumbled, and there was some
  sort of big discovery.
0003: |
  Goodbye.
Talk_1062: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>That said, I would wait until it stops
  raining. The mountain will be too slippery
  to climb safely.
  Please feel free to relax at our inn until
  the weather calms down.
