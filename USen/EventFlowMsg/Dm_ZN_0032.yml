  Long ago, my people, known as the Zonai, came down
  from the heavens to the surface of the world. It was
  said they were descendants of gods...
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_009_b: |
  Rauru then came up with a plan to turn the tide
  of the war.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_005_b: |
  However, tragedy suddenly struck.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_007_c: |
  Using the secret stone, Ganondorf transformed into
  the Demon King.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_011_b: |
  Rauru and the sages outnumbered the Demon King 
  and should have been able to stop him.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_003_b: |
  Rauru gifted Sonia one of the secret stones.
  Together they sought to establish their kingdom.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_007_d: |
  He then created swarms of monsters and attacked.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_001_b: |
  They bore treasures from these same godsâ€”secret
  stones, capable of amplifying the abilities of those
  who possessed them.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_008_b: |
  Hyrule rose up to face these threats, but the evil
  power driving the monsters forward was staggering.
  The defenders were on the brink of defeat...
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_006_b: |
  A man of great evil emerged from the desert.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_012_b: |
  However...
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_004_b: |
  This is how the kingdom of Hyrule, with Rauru and
  Sonia as its first king and queen, came to be.
  The future looked bright...
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_006_c: |
  The leader of the Gerudo, Ganondorf, killed Queen
  Sonia and stole her secret stone.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_010_b: |
  He entrusted secret stones to warriors with
  exceptional abilities. They became sages and united
  in an effort to finally defeat the Demon King.
Dm_ZN_0032_Text_002_b: |
  Using the knowledge of the Zonai, my younger
  brother, Rauru, became a great leader. He met a
  young woman named Sonia, and they would wed.
