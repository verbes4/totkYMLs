  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>I think you'll find him near the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lone cedar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  on <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Talonto Peak<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's visible to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  after you leave the cave.

  Gaaah!

  You may pass.

  He's still not here...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>I'm waiting for Tulin. We were supposed
  to go looking for food together, but he's
  running late.<0 Type='4'/>Probably still getting ready at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rito Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  I can wait a little longer.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>It's past time for us to get to work.
  Could Tulin still be at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rito Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?<0 Type='4'/>Nothing to do but keep waiting, I guess.
Npc_Talk009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>We have no way of knowing what we'll
  find above those clouds...<0 Type='4'/>If I was going up there, I'd make sure
  I was prepared for the worst.

  Far from it.<0 Type='4'/>Everyone admires his <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ability to generate
  his own gusts<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. No one else in the village
  can do anything like it.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003100'/>The problem is he knows he's talented,
  and it makes him headstrong and prone
  to acting rashly. His youth doesn't help.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>But I shouldn't be standing around talking
  to passing travelers about this.<0 Type='4'/>I need to report this to Harth so we can
  discuss what to do about it.

  head into that cave.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Our investigations haven't revealed what's
