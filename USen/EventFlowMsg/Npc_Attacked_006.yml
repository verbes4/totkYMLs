  You're looking for treasure, aren't you?
  
  
  Me too. The outfit's just so I could

  attracting suspicion.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I thought it'd give me access to some

  those out. Worse yet,<5 Type='0'/> they put me on
  dangerous investigations!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>If you're a treasure hunter, these woods
  are a great place to search. Lots of caves
  and old ruins.
  I even found one <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave that looked like
  a ruin<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>! And let me tell you, that place
  reeked of treasure.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I just wish I didn't get lost right after I
