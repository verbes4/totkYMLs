  Vasaaq. This is the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>icehouse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's where
  we store ice...<5 Type='0'/>obviously. It's all made from
  snowmelt from the Gerudo Highlands.
  I'm kind of surprised to see you here.
  It isn't really a tourist destination.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But you're probably wondering where all
  the ice is, right? Well, it's gotten hot
  enough that it all melted.
  Feels wrong to even call the place an
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>icehouse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> right now...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Have you heard about the incredibly
  popular drink the Noble Canteen in town
  makes? Well, it uses ice from here.
  Or it did. If I can't get ice delivered to
  town, there won't be any signature drinks
  being made by anyone.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>I've got to find a way to make ice...
talk0023: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The desert has been hotter than usual
  and all my ice keeps melting. I'm getting
  kind of steamed. Heh heh.
  But you Hylians can make ice, right?
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Any chance you can help me out with
  some freezy goodness? I need ice!
talk0017: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I won't argue that there is now ice in
  the alcove. That much is true.
  
  But how much ice?<5 Type='1'/> Not a lot, not a lot...<5 Type='1'/>
  This chunk of ice is just <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>too small<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It'll
  melt before it makes it to town.
  Why don't you use the size of the alcove
  to measure? If the ice is <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>around the same
  width<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> as the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>alcove<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, that should do fine!

  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>icehouse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. It's not really a place
  tourists tend to check out though.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>But if you're wondering where the ice
  is, well... It's gotten hot enough that it
  all melted down.

talk0018: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Hm? What...<5 Type='1'/>happened?
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I haven't gotten any orders for ice lately,
  no doubt due to this strange <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  that won't seem to go away...
  So if I don't have any ice to deliver when
  the orders finally come, everyone back
  home will be really disappointed...
  <0 Type='3' Data='0200'/><FontSize Value='80'/>I simply cannot allow anything to come between

talk0019: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, you've put some ice in the alcove

talk0003: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Now that the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>has finally died
  down, I expect the demand for ice to pick
  right up again!
  So if I can't deliver any ice because I
  don't have any, everyone back home
  will be really disappointed...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You know, on the really, really <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cold<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  nights, I sometimes see a thin layer of ice
  forming on the surface of the water.
  It's always melted by the time morning
  comes though. There must be some way
  to get <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ice <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in here...
talk0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Feel free to come back and make more
  ice, OK? 
  
  Er, but I don't have anything I can give
  you as a reward right now...
  
  It wouldn't feel right to accept your help
  when I can't repay you, so give me some
  time, OK?
  You could always visit the spa in Gerudo
  Town in the mean—
  
  Oh, wait.<5 Type='1'/> You're a voe, so you aren't
  allowed inside Gerudo Town. <5 Type='1'/>Maybe you
  could relax at Kara Kara Bazaar instead?

  Th-the ice...

  Water again...
talk0007: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hey! That's ice, isn't it?
  
  
  I didn't know Hylians could make ice!
  Maybe I've been in the icehouse—or up
  on the mountain—for too long...
  Anyway, if it's OK with you, could I have
  this ice?
near0002: |
  Ice...
talk0008: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Oh, hey! Perfectly sized ice! This'll
  definitely hold up on the trip to town.
  That's great!
talk0021: |
  If it's possible to make a hunk of ice that
  fits nicely in that alcove, that would
  be ideal.

  Can I have this ice?
talk0009: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Sarq!
  
  
  Hopefully this is something you can make
  use of! Be sure to grab something to drink
  at the canteen in town!

  Just a bunch of water...
