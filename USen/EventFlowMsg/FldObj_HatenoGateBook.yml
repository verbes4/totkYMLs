  They're calling it <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Upheaval<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Apt name
  for it, I'd say.<0 Type='4'/>Strange ruins fell from the sky onto the
  plains west of here, and there are reports
  of spindly, mechanical monsters.<0 Type='4'/>This sort of thing is happening all over
  Hyrule, apparently.<0 Type='4'/>I'm fortunate that neither I nor my home
  were harmed, but such an event is sure to
  have caused major damage elsewhere.<0 Type='4'/>The more outlandish rumors suggest that
  Hyrule Castle has risen into the sky.
  Rather difficult to credit that one.<0 Type='4'/>What could have caused all this? I can
  feel the desire to find the truth welling
  up within me.

  I received a visitor. He was a researcher
  from some outfit calling themselves the
  Zonai Survey Team.<0 Type='4'/>He claimed to be merely passing through
  the area, but clearly he had come to draw
  on my expertise.<0 Type='4'/>According to his story, large ruins have
  fallen on <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, northwest of
  this house.<0 Type='4'/>People are calling them the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>A great many inquisitive types like me
  are gathering in Kakariko Village to
  investigate them.<0 Type='4'/>I see little choice but to join them.
  Without my intellect, they're bound to
  leap to all the wrong conclusions.<0 Type='4'/>The man history will remember as The
  Genius Dr. Calip shall solve this mystery
  faster than I can clean my glasses!

  My preparations are complete. It's time
  for me to depart for Kakariko Village.<0 Type='4'/>I foresee a day not long off when all the
  members of this survey team address me
  with respect and by my proper title.<0 Type='4'/>I will not return to this house until I am
  known by all as a doctorâ€”nay, as
  a genius.<0 Type='4'/>This area has long been plagued by
  monsters, so I will leave this house in
  good order as a place of refuge.<0 Type='4'/>To you travelers who might read what
  I have penned here, rest well.<0 Type='4'/>You are of course welcome to use any of
  the things I have left behind.
