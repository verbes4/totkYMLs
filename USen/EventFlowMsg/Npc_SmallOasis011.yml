  Are you a member of that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>caravan squad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  heading to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
0004: |
  Caravan squad?
talk0001: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0900'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e005000610069006e00660075006c00'/>Our spears are no match for them!
  Have they no weaknesses?!
0005: |
  Goodbye.
talk0002: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I had to fire those voe from the caravan
  squad who were helping us guard
  the oasis.
  Those idiots... When the monsters
  attacked, they fled into the inn before
  even the civilians could.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Not all voe are as brave as you, it seems.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is to the southwest of here.
  It's the biggest town in the region!
  
  That said, the laws of the Gerudo forbid
  voe—men—from entering the town.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>Though, voe or not...
  
  
  under this terrible <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, it would
  take a near miracle to reach the town in
  the first place.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I recommend you follow the example of
  the voe of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>caravan squad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and give
  up on even trying for now.
AssassinClothes: |
  It can't be!
talk0004: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>They're a group of Hylian merchants.
  
  
  It's not as though they can do business in
  this <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so they're helping out
  by guarding the entrance here.
  <4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003000'/>It's clear their plan is to gain access to
  Gerudo Town by getting into our
  good graces...<0 Type='4'/>But our law about voe is absolute. We
  couldn't let them in if we wanted to.
talk0010: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Even with the sand shroud cleared up,
  the desert is still a dangerous place full
  of monsters.
  We must remain vigilant at all costs.
ThunderHelmet: |
  Is that helm— Never mind.
talk0005: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Oh, you're not with them?
  
  
  Well, nonetheless, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is
  especially harsh for you Hylians, so you
  should stay put.
near0000: |
  Always be vigilant.
talk0006: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The road from Kara Kara Bazaar to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Gerudo Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is closed because of
  the sand shroud.
  You're welcome to help the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>caravan squad<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  guard this place in the meantime though!
talk0013: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, in any case, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is
  particularly harsh for you Hylians, so
  you should stay here.
near0001: |
  They're tough!
0000: |
  Gerudo Town?
talk0014: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Well, even if you're not with them, you
  shouldn't leave here regardless.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004c00610075006700680053005f0030003100'/>Hah! I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
talk0015: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I allowed myself to have high hopes, but
  the caravan squad really disappointed me.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Clearly not all voe possess your courage...
