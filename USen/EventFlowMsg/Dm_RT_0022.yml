  Years ago, when the kingdom of Hyrule was
  still young...
Dm_RT_0022_Text_001_b: |
  A great evil, the Demon King, descended on the land.
  He sought to wipe out anyone who opposed him.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_002_b: |
  But Rauru—the first king of Hyrule—requested my aid,
  as well as that of five other warriors.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_003_b: |
  To help in the fight, Rauru entrusted us with
  amazing artifacts.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_004_b: |
  Secret stones...objects that amplified our
  formidable abilities.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_005_b: |
  I carried one into battle as the Sage of Wind. It was
  thrilling to fight alongside my fellow sages...
Dm_RT_0022_Text_006_b: |
  Yet we were still no match for the Demon King's
  overwhelming power.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_007_b: |
  His magic was staggering, and I was unable to slip
  past his defenses, no matter how hard I tried.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_004_c: |
  To fight the Demon King, Rauru gave us
  secret stones.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_009_c: |
  In the end, King Rauru realized that we would not be
  able to defeat the Demon King.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_004_d: |
  Powerful objects that enhanced our formidable
  abilities.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_010_b: |
  To save our world, King Rauru sacrificed himself and
  sealed the Demon King away.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_011_b: |
  So that was the Imprisoning War...
Dm_RT_0022_Text_016_b: |
  The Demon King will return. The magic binding him
  will be undone.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_019_b: |
  It was clear what part the Rito would play.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_020_b: |
  It will be an honor to defeat the Demon King.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_021_b: |
  I swear to you that when the Demon King returns,
  the Rito Sage of Wind will awaken once more.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_022_b: |
  And you can count on the full support of the Rito!
Dm_RT_0022_Text_013_c: |
  The rest of us survived that climactic battle, and I
  would soon receive a visitor with a request that would
  define the future of the Rito.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_014_c: |
  It was another of the six sages—the Sage of Time.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_017_c: |
  When that time comes, a noble swordsman named
  Link will oppose him.
Dm_RT_0022_Text_018_c: |
  But Link will only succeed with the Rito's help.
  Summon the winds, and support this hero!
Dm_RT_0022_Text_014_d: |
  Some time later...
Dm_RT_0022_Text_014_e: |
  Another of the six sages—the Sage of Time—came to
  visit me, and her request would define the Rito's
  mission in the future.
