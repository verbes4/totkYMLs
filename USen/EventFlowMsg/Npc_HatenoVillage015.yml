  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Have you seen the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring-shaped ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on

  But when I'm looking out that way, I'm
  thinking of what's beyond the ruinsâ€”
  my dear <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  So, I'm keeping watch for monsters, of
  course, but I also keep <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>seeing those
  strange ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000540069007200650064005f0030003100'/>Which then leads me to worry more about

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>You're a curious one, being up here
  when everyone's down below.<5 Type='0'/>
  The name's Thadd.
  I'm from a place that's almost as far
  to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>southeast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> as you can get from
  here. It's called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  I've been worried about my family back
  home. So if you catch me sneaking a
  peek thataway, <5 Type='0'/>well, that's why.

  I was NOT just gazing off toward my
  hometown. Of course not. I'm on the
  lookout for monsters.
  ...
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Problem is, when I keep watch from
  here, I see the<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> ring-shaped ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in
  the distance.
  Just so happens that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is
  out that way, beyond the horizon.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>My village is indebted to Princess Zelda.
  
  
  I wanted to offer some kind of assistance
  in return, so I came here.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>But I'm worried sick about my wife and
  son back in <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hateno Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  
  That's far beyond those <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring-shaped
  ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the distance, so I keep looking
  out that way.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>But I'm keeping proper watch, don't
  you worry!
