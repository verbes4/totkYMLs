  You must really appreciate good cooking

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>I wanted to make the recipe I saw

  Actually, I'd memorized them, but
  one can never be too certain! Best
  to double-check...

  You really saved my bacon.

  Hylian rice... And add meat. Looks like any ol'
  meat will do the trick.
  Next, add in a bird egg and sauté it up. I see, I see.
  Maybe I'll whip up this beauty later.<FontSize Value='100'/>
