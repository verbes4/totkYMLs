  my friends in Gerudo Canyon, right?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>We went our separate ways after that.
  
  
  I was walking around, feeling lonely,
  when I heard this pretty melody and just
  had to stop and listen.

  you for a music lover!

  journey that brought me here.
  
  I was so hopeless after my friends got
  lost in Gerudo Canyon.
  
  But they got out safe in the end.<5 Type='0'/>
  All thanks to you, of course!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yeah! Now's my chance! I can listen to
  the music from up close!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This really brings me back. I can almost

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>I wonder how they're doing...
