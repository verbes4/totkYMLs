  Sand seals?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sand seals are especially sensitive to the

  Wild sand seals?

  You'll need one if you want to go sand-
  seal surfing.
  I can sell you one though! It'd bring the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Sand seals are special animals that live in
  the Gerudo Desert.
  
  I'm sure you've noticed your feet getting
  stuck in the sand when you walk across
  the dunes, right?
  Well, not only do these little ones call
  the desert their home but they breeze
  through it with ease!
  That's only one reason that they're vital
  to our way of life!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And they aren't easy to catch and train
  either! It takes a lot of work!
  
  Luckily, folks like me are happy to do it.
  I'm proud of the sand seals I've trained,
  and I'm happy to rent them to travelers!
talk0026: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Yup! <5 Type='0'/>You'll often see them if you're out
  wandering in the desert.
  
  But they're extremely wary creatures.<5 Type='0'/>
  If they notice you, they'll flee faster than
  you can say "vasaaq"!
  Of course, I've mastered the art of
  stealth. <5 Type='0'/>I can easily sneak up on them
  very, very slowly...
talk0027: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Even if you manage to get hold of a wild
  sand seal...
  
  the moment you let those reins drop, that
  sand seal is done with you and heading
  for the dunes!
  Most folks don't want to go through all
  the trouble, so they just rent one instead.

  A sand seal, please.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I hope the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sand shroud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> clears up soon.

  You won't regret it!

  After being down in the shelter for so
