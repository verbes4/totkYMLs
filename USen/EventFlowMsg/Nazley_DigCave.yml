  Leave it to me.

  trying to collect what food we could
  from this cave.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>As you can see, a cave-in closed off
  the entrance, and I can't get in.

  There's food in that cave, but I can't bring
  it back to the village if I can't get in.
  
  Seems my only option is to dig through
  those rocks. Even getting prepped for
  that could take a while though...
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>Hmm. <5 Type='0'/>Maybe I should just cut my losses
  and give up on this for today.

  How am I supposed to get inside now?

  I wasn't planning on it...

  That's it for the entrance...

  I hate to leave all that food behind, but
  maybe I just need to call today a wash

  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>It'd be great if you could make a hole <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>big
  enough <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for me to walk through.
  
  That will let me bring the supply of food
  in the cave back to the village.
Near02: |
  There's no other way in...
Talk04: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>This isn't good. The cave entrance is
  completely blocked off!
  
  Ugh, why didn't I harvest bomb flowers
  from the other caves? I could've used
  them to blow these rocks away.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>There's still food in that cave I haven't
  hauled out... I have to get in there
  somehow.

  It doesn't seem like there's any way in
  except through these rocks. And I did not
  come here prepared to dig.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>Hmmm. <5 Type='0'/>Maybe I just need to call it a day
  and come back tomorrow.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>Now I can bring some supplies back to

  Oh, right, I need to reward you somehow,
  don't I? <5 Type='0'/>Here, take this.

  a chance.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>I was searching the cave for food to bring
  back to the village, but a cave-in blocked
  off the entrance and put a stop to that.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0101'/>But now, thanks to you, I can fly the

  He's out collecting food at another cave
  right now. I'm pretty sure he was with
  Gesane's group.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>There's a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bonfire<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> burning outside the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>entrance <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of the cave he was headed to,

  It'll be a good place to warm up and rest
  if you feel yourself starting to freeze too.
