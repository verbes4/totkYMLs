  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Anyway! Since you're here already, you

  And if you don't have enough to pay for it
  right now, you can always try the spa plan
  that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Olu<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, her apprentice, offers.
  <FontSize Value='80'/>But, well... Just keep in mind that it's discounted for

  So you really did get special permission
  to be in here, huh?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/>All the same, you should still be on your
  best behavior.
  
  You wouldn't want to end up thrown out
  or in jail. That's what normally happens
  when men come here.

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Olu<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is apprenticing under <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Romah<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  She's the only vai who has ever had
  the opportunity to inherit Romah's
  special technique.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But...she's still learning. The effects of
  her spa plan are a bit less reliable, you
  might say.
  The price is more affordable though!
  If you're in the mood to take a chance,
  you should give it a shot!
