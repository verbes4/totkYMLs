  The shape of that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring garland<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is

  They're made at a place called <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko

  You'll find them for sale in a place

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>Ah...it's almost as if I can hear the bell's

  If you ever capture a different <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture

  What a nice garland.
Com_Photo_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>This sure brings back the memories...<5 Type='1'/>
  You see,<5 Type='0'/> I did ring it once.
  
  My wife and I rang it together, in fact.
  And here we are, still happy together,
  all thanks to that bell.

  He can even resurrect a horse!<0 Type='4'/>Isn't that amazing? I bet anyone who

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003100'/>*sigh* I wish he'd settled a little closer to

  It would make my daughters very happy

  I'd like to change it.

Com_Photo_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>I asked my family what sort of picture we
  should put up,<5 Type='0'/> and we've finally decided.
  
  Have you seen the "Unity Bell" in
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tarrey Town<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> over in the east?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003100'/>The story goes that if two people ring it
  together, their love will last forever.<5 Type='0'/>
  All sorts of couples pay it a visit.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Anyway, I think it would be nice to paint a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of the Unity Bell<5 Type='0'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>and hang it here
  at the stable.
  All four of my daughters think it would
  look perfect on the wall too!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>But...I really need to go see it if I'm going
  to paint it accurately.<5 Type='0'/> And, well, work is
  far too busy for me to get away.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Of course...if I had a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of the
  bell in front of me,<5 Type='0'/> I could just use
  that as reference.
