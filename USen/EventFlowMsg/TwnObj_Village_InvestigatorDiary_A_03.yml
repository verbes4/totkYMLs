  The Stone Slab at the Eastern Ring Ruin:
  Some Translation Notes
  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 　-Tauro
  "Wind, flame, water, lightning...and
  time... Light... Who holds the power...
  secret stone...and...<0 Type='4'/>"That person...dwell within...power... 
  amplify... Great...might...display..."<0 Type='4'/>The thrust of the message on this slab is
  about something called secret stones.<0 Type='4'/>"Those who held powers such as wind,
  flame, water, lightning—and light and
  time—amplified them with secret stones.<0 Type='4'/>"They used the stones to attain great
  might to accomplish their goals."<0 Type='4'/>That's what I'm guessing it would say if
  we could read the whole thing.
