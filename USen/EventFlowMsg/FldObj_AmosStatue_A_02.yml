  Poes...
talk1001: |
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are pitiful beings who have lost their
  way home and wander the depths of
  this land.
  Good... Evil... That's the futile perspective
  of narrow-minded beings. There is no
  such distinction in wandering spirits.
  You have already obtained <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
talk1014: |
  Is that so...
  
  
  Visit me again if you decide to offer <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  
  I will grant you suitable compensation.
talk1027: |
  But it seems one of my brethren cannot
  make use of his power.
  
  What could this mean?
talk1002: |
  Yes... Oh, this is indeed a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poe<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk1015: |
  I acknowledge your offering...<5 Type='0'/> I will tell
  you of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>location of one of my brethren<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  in the depths of the land.

  Yes... Oh, this is indeed a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poe<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  
  
  What pitiful beings these are. They have
  lost their way home, and wander the
  depths of this land.
talk1016: |
  Seek out wandering spirits for my
  brethren in the depths of this land.
talk1004: |
  ...
  
  
  I have returned the lost spirit to the
  afterlife where it belongs.
  
  Since I was brought here to the surface,
  I have been unable to return Poes to the
  afterlife.
  Because of you, I can assist them once
  again. You should take this.
talk1017: |
  Farewell...
talk1018: |
  I no longer have anything to offer you.
talk1006: |
  ...
  
  
  Have you...encountered my brethren in
  the depths of the land?
  
  Wait just a moment...
talk1019: |
  It seems you do not have enough Poes
  to offer...
talk1007: |
  My <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brethren<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, whose spirits reside in
  statues far larger than mine, are in the
  depths of this land.
  If you encounter my <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>brethren<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, try offering
  Poes to them.

  Offer <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Poes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to me. They are spirits that
  ought to return to the afterlife.

  Poes?

talk1022: |
  Poes...
1002: |
