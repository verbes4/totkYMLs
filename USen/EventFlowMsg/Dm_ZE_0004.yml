  But if you, like Sonia, have a secret stone and are able
  to manipulate time, then your story makes sense.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_011_bb: |
  You had said that you needed to return to
  your era as soon as you possibly could...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_013_b: |
  In my time, something terrible is happening...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_020_c: |
  It is true, after all!
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_005_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_023_b: |
  I don't know what to say...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_008_b: |
  Additionally, I sense that we share a
  blood connection.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_016_b: |
  Now, Zelda, dear...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_023_ab: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_000_b: |
  As I thought...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_008_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_016_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_019_b: |
  We'll tell everyone that you're...a distant relative
  of ours.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_026_c: |
  Mineru, you said?
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_029_b: |
  And like us, my older sister has a secret stone.
  We'll call on her.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_003_c: |
  So it's true. This is really the era of
  Hyrule's founding?
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_021_b: |
  We'll get you fresh clothes too.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_006_b: |
  Oh? I believed her right away. You needed the secret
  stone as proof, Rauru?
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_021_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_005_ab: |
  Your presence here is just as strange to us, Zelda.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_c: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_009_b: |
  Ah. I see.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_017_b: |
  You don't need to solve your problems all at once.
  Why not come back with us to the castle?
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_024_c: |
  Hm, I wonder...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_001_b: |
  This is not the world I know.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_bab: |
  I need to get back there, but how do I do that?
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_027_c: |
  Yes... She knows far more than anyone about
  our people.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_bac: |
  I don't even know how I got here in the first place.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_012_c: |
  Yes.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_022_b: |
  I'm sure an answer will come to you. Wisdom
  takes time.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_007_b: |
  I can feel your light power within her. As well as my
  time power.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_015_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_014_bb: |
  
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_018_b: |
  No...I...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_025_c: |
  Mineru... She may have some idea of how
  to get you back to your era.
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_002_b: |
  A time so far back in the past, it's become legend...
Dm_ZE_0004_Text_010_b: |
  In any case, Zelda...
