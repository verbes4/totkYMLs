  We had to run away.<0 Type='4'/>I wish I could climb a Skyview Tower and

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Eventide Island<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to the east.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>But they probably won't come tonight.
  Pirates have to sleep too, right?<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You know what? I'm gonna go to bed too.
  Don't want the pirates to be better-rested

  <3 Type='0' Data='0401'/>So, the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pirates<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> aren't there anymore?
  What about the head of the village or the
  "son and done" guy—<5 Type='0'/>are they OK?
  ...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>Sorry. I've been really worried about
  our village.
  
  I thought about climbing the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skyview
  Tower <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to get a look, but it's got a bunch
  of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>spike <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>thingies around it...<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>But that's OK. If something happened,

  I just have to be a good kid and wait!

  I think I'll climb that Skyview Tower and

  later maybe!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>I had such a good idea. I was going to

  look at Lurelin Village in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>south<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But my mom found out and got so mad!
  Said it was too dangerous... <5 Type='0'/>Pfft.<0 Type='4'/><FontSize Value='80'/>Too bad lectures don't sink pirate ships... My mom
