  slopes on a shield. Like, give you
  challenges. Teach you what's what.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>And if ya go shield surfing and your
  shield breaks, no problem. Come back

  I'll give ya my very own shield, totally

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Ask our coach, Selmie. She'll get ya

  If all that sliding busts your shield, come

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>It's tougher than other shields. Takes a
  beating on the slopes, no matter how
  harsh the terrain. Lasts a long time.
  Oh yeah, a real beauty as well!
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>They say that shield is somewhere inside
