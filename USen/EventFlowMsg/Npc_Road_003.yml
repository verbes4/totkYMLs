  The Ring Ruins?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>You probably know that fallen Zonai ruins
  have been found all over the world since
  the Upheaval.
  Well, the ones at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kakariko Village<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> have
  been dubbed the "Ring Ruins," owing to
  their distinctive <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>circular shapes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  There's also some stone slabs there with
  words like "sage" and "Demon King"
  carved in Zonai script.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>The leader of our team—the best in the
  world at deciphering Zonai script—is
  heading up the investigation in person.
  It's all very, very exciting. I just wish the
  place was a little easier to get to...

  You look busy.

  head toward that ring-shaped thing in
  the distance.
  That's one of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Ring Ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<5 Type='0'/> Lots of folks
