  So when you and Princess Zelda go
  beneath Hyrule Castle...
Dm_BC_0012_Text_001_b: |
  you discover a mysterious mummy...
Dm_BC_0012_Text_007_c: |
  and learn that your new arm belonged
  to someone named Rauru.
Dm_BC_0012_Text_010_b: |
  You hear the princess's voice...and find
  your way here.
Dm_BC_0012_Text_002_b: |
  which suddenly reanimates.
Dm_BC_0012_Text_008_c: |
  The Master Sword disappears.
Dm_BC_0012_Text_003_b: |
  Then Zelda falls into a fissure
  and vanishes.
Dm_BC_0012_Text_004_b: |
  That must have been when the castle rose
  and the ruins fell...
Dm_BC_0012_Text_005_c: |
  Then later you wake up on a sky island,
  saved by the arm that was stuck to
  the mummy.
Dm_BC_0012_Text_006_b: |
  You get the Purah Pad from an
  unusual creature...
