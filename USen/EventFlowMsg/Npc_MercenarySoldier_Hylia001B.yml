  While we're stunned that the Demon King
  is back, we won't allow it to dampen the
  spirits of the monster-control crew!
  I imagine you may be heading out shortly.
Talk_0030: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I work with the monster-control crew.<0 Type='4'/>We're tasked with protecting everyone
  from monsters. There's been an uptick in
  their populations since the Upheaval.
  But I'm not really the most skilled
  in combat.<0 Type='4'/>So instead, I use my knowledge of the
  areas to help determine where we should

  Smart thinking, taking off when the night

  That's my entire field of study.
  When I'm out on a deployment with the
