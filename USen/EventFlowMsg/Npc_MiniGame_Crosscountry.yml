  <3 Type='0' Data='0400'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c004e006f007400690063006500'/>Nope, nope, nope.<5 Type='1'/> Don't you come talk to
  me looking like that. I can't be seen with
  someone who cares so little for clothing.
  I'm not saying you have to dress fancy,
  but at least put on a shirt or some
  trousers, you know?
NakedPlayer: |
  At least get dressed.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That was amazing! <5 Type='0'/>Look, I call a lot of
  people "superstar," but you really earn it!<5 Type='0'/>
  Thank you!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That'sâ€”<5 Type='0'/> That's fantastic! Ugh, I've been
  cooped up in here forever.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>The name's Konba.
  
  
  I've got a knack for style and the nimble
  digits I need to spin my ideas into reality.
  
  Alas, that pure talent is why the Yiga Clan
  kidnapped me and forced me to make
  their outfits for them.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>If I ever sew one of those tacky rags
  again, it'll be too soon.<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>In fact, you should take the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Yiga armor<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  I just finished. Burn it, toss it, do what
  you want. Just get it away from me.

  So on trend...

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>The look may lack, but my tailoring is
  sublime. If you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wore the whole set<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, you'd
  fit right in with the Yiga Clan.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>On that note, I gotta hurry out of here
  before they get back.
  
  Don't worry, I'm more athletic than I look.
  They only caught me last time because I
  messed up. It won't happen again.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>See you round, and thanks for the save!
