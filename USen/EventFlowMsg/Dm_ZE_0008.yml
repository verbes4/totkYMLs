  I came... I came to this era after finding a
  man underground.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_005_b: |
  Go on.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_018_c: |
  I must atone for my error in judgment.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_007_c: |
  What we found undergroundâ€”that was him!
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_011_bb: |
  We won't be able to defeat him. No matter how strong
  we think we are, he'll survive!
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_020_c: |
  I remain the king of Hyrule. As with any leader, it is
  my duty to safeguard and protect my people.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_022_b: |
  Rauru...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_009_d: |
  He continues to live on...all the way until my time!
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_024_c: |
  we rely on your knight...and that legendary sword
  he carries.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_013_c: |
  Maybe so...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_015_b: |
  
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_026_c: |
  But remember, that was a future where you never
  appeared in this world. And you are here now.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_028_b: |
  The reason I...am here...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_000_c: |
  Sonia...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_026_ab: |
  
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_002_c: |
  King Rauru... Before you face the Demon King
  tomorrow, there is something I must tell you.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_004_b: |
  Hm.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_017_c: |
  It was my hubris that set us on this path.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_019_c: |
  And above all else...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_006_d: |
  When I witnessed what the secret stone did to
  Ganondorf... At that moment, I knew for sure.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_008_c: |
  He was still alive... Still powerful...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_021_c: |
  Even if I must risk my life.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_010_c: |
  In tomorrow's battle...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_023_c: |
  And if it proves impossible for us to
  defeat Ganondorf...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_012_ac: |
  
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_012_c: |
  And you... And you will...
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_022_ab: |
  
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_025_c: |
  Our last line of defense will be Link.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_014_c: |
  But it is my duty to try.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_027_c: |
  Zelda... I believe there is a reason you were sent
  to us. It has to mean something.
Dm_ZE_0008_Text_001_c: |
  Oh, Zelda...
