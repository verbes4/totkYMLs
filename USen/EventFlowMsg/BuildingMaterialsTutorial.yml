  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I heard that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Princess Zelda<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> was sighted
  at Hyrule Castle, which has me all kinds
  of curious.
  But it's my job to care for the horses
  properly so those who go out searching
  have healthy transport.
  I'll leave the business regarding Princess
  Zelda to everyone else.
