  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Once I spruce up my wardrobe with a few
  Misko pieces, maybe I'll go west to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lucky
  Clover Gazette<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>They've got a set of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>froggy clothes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> there.
  Wouldn't it be nice to travel through the
  rain in comfort?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Y'know, those clothes really do look
  froggy. A perfect design for a rainy day.<0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>That's a great outfit, fella! You're making
  an old man jealous.

  Gotta go!

  this pair of treasure-hunting brothers
  might have a lead...<0 Type='4'/>But I went way out west to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the cave near

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>At first I thought I might ask the horse

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>That's why I plan on going to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>East Akkala

  East Akkala Stable is an establishment on

  going, but I've always wanted to see
  what the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>northeast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> had to offer.
  There's joy in any journey, so long as
  you look.

  So...thanks!
  
  Still, I couldn't help wondering if there

  Now here I am, in Akkala.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Have you ever heard of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Misko's treasure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?<5 Type='0'/>
  It's a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>collection of rare clothes<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> gathered
  up and hidden away by the bandit Misko!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>I'm fairly sure a piece of that treasure is
  tucked away in a cave here in Akkala!
  
  You helped me out of a jam, so I'll tell you
  everything I know. If you're interested,
  just ask!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Rumor has it there are rare clothes
  stashed somewhere on Lomei Labyrinth
  Island <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>northeast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of here.
  But it's so far off coast, there's no way to
  swim there. You'd need an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>undersea
  tunnel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or something to reach it.
Near_GoalPoint_01: |
  I want that treasure.

  Rainy-day clothes...
