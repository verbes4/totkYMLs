  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>One of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bones in this cutie's spine<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>

Talk10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>They should be right around here.
Talk05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>*sigh* <5 Type='1'/>Every step I took on the long walk
  here, I thought,<5 Type='1'/> "I can't wait to see the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fully intact leviathan fossil<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>I bet the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>missing bones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> are still right

  My money's on SUPER adorable!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0100'/>What am I doing waiting around here?<5 Type='1'/>

  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>Are you seeing what I'm seeing?!<5 Type='0'/>
  How adorable is the sharp, little mouth
  on this leviathan skeleton?
  He looks so different from the one in
  Eldin too. Maybe he's another species?<0 Type='4'/>Or should I say "she"? What if they're the
  same species, but one's a boy and one's
  a girl!<5 Type='0'/> Oh, it's just so fascinating!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0053006900670068005f0030003000'/>Which makes it even sadder...<5 Type='1'/>that some of
