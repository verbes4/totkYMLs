  monsters lately. I wonder if it's because
  of the Upheaval.
  And they seem more aggressive too.
  I never thought they'd be bold enough to
  launch an attack from the sea.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>They're behaving just like <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pirates<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!

  I was so relieved that everyone in the

  But still, it was awful...all we could do was
