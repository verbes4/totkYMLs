  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>...Good evening.<0 Type='4'/>Pardon me. I was a bit absorbed in
  my thoughts.
Talk_01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>This relic is a special device. It has some
  great purpose, as yet unknown to me.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0501'/>I have to find it out before the researchers
  east in Kakariko Village or northeast in
  Tarrey Town beat me to the punch.
  I want to be known as the one who
  unraveled this mystery!
Moving_Mornig: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Apologies, but I'm headed to my post.
  Can we talk later?
Talk_02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>By the bridge up ahead, there's a strange
  spherical relic I have been studying. But
  it's not the only one of its kind.
  Similar relics have been sighted in two
  other places—<5 Type='0'/>Kakariko Village in the east
  and Tarrey Town to the northeast.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>Perhaps I should try studying each of
  them to see if they have any common
  features.
Talk_03: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Researchers in Kakariko Village to the
  east and Tarrey Town to the northeast
  are also studying the spherical relics.
  Well! I'm dead set on figuring out their
  secrets before they do.
Moving_Rain: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Apologies, but I'd like to shelter from this
  rain over in the tent. Can this wait?

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>...Good day.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065005300'/>You did it! You got it to work!<0 Type='4'/>How did you—<5 Type='0'/> Wait, don't tell me.
  Let me figure it out.
Talk_05: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>So, if you put something on that dish,
  it gets sucked in...
Balloon_Evening: |
  Are they all...similar?
Talk_06: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='0a005400680069006e006b00'/>How in the world did you get that thing
  out of there?<0 Type='4'/>Actually, don't tell me. I want to work it
  out for myself.
Talk_08: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/><4 Type='0' Data='0c005300610064005f0030003000'/>Oh... Just a dream.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0300'/>I've been researching the spherical relic
  up ahead near the suspension bridges.
  
  But other researchers are studying similar
  sites in Kakariko Village to the east and
  Tarrey Town to the northeast.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>I want to solve the relic riddles before
  they do, but there's so much work left...<5 Type='1'/>
  The urgency makes it hard to sleep.
Talk_09: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>All I can think about are those spherical
  relics. They've even started to make
  appearances in my dreams.
  I don't want to lose out to those
  researchers in Kakariko Village to the
  east or Tarrey Town to the northeast.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a01'/>But I'm so sleepy...<5 Type='1'/>
Balloon_Day: |
  Is it some kind of device?
Greeting_Morning: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>...Good morning.
Talk_00: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>What an unusual relic. And look... <5 Type='1'/>There's
  something inside.
  
  I believe this device is meant for some
  special purpose, but as for what that
  may be, who knows?
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Similar devices have been found in
  Kakariko Village to the east and Tarrey
  Town to the northeast.
  I want to unlock this gizmo's secrets
  before the researchers in those other
  places do. I must!
Moving_Evening: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>Apologies, but I was just on my way back
  to the tent. Can we pick this up later?
