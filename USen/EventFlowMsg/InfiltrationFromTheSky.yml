  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>It's been a while, so maybe I should go

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Huh?!<5 Type='0'/> You're not even a Korok, and you
  still got there?! Woooooow!
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0000'/>Isn't it great? It's my secret, even from
  the other Koroks. Don't tell!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/>And! You <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>can see an island floating in the

  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Oh, but since it's covered in lost fog,
  only Koroks can go there.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0a00'/>So you can't come with me. But...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I'll tell you where to find it.<5 Type='1'/> Could you
  show me your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>map<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
