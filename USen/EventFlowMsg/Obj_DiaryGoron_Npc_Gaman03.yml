  Today President Yunobo is treating
  everyone to this new stuff called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>marbled rock roast<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  But it's kinda weird around here lately.
  He hasn't been himself since he started
  wearing that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>strange mask<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Some of the others are acting
  funny too...
  
  But President Yunobo is being mighty
  generous, treating all of us to a
  fancy meal.

  Mine-Cart Land has opened!
  
  
  President Yunobo told the three of us to
  "Make 'em smile big!"
  
  Mine-Cart Land is making use of the
  Southern Mine that's been out of
  commission for a while now.
  The mineral market is nearby too, which
  will definitely make travelers smile from
  ear to ear!

  My two brothers and I have started work
  at YunoboCo, which is really taking off!
  
  YunoboCo is a big company that's
  single-handedly taking on mining
  in Eldin.
  President Yunobo, who heads up the
  company, is all about making
  Gorons smile.
  He wants to make travelers visiting
  Goron City smile too.
  
  So the three of us have important work
  to do!
  
  I'm going to do all I can to make
  President Yunobo proud.
