  top of the Skyview Tower?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Hmm. The terminal and the lid on top
  of the tower are connected...
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>So if the lid wouldn't work because it
  was blocked, <5 Type='0'/>I guess the terminal
  wouldn't work either.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Well. <5 Type='1'/>I'm in a hurry, and everything seems
  to be working properly, <5 Type='0'/>so I'll head out.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Thank you for fixing the Skyview Tower.
  I'm off!

  Skyview Tower isn't working.
  
  I've checked all the terminal's parts,<5 Type='0'/>
  but nothing looks broken.

  tower itself is broken.

  What's wrong?
Talk_10: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/>I came to repair this Skyview Tower, but
  the terminal hasn't been working.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c01'/>Until now! It started working again...<5 Type='0'/>even
  without me doing anything!

  though I didn't do anything...
