  <3 Type='0' Data='0801'/><4 Type='0' Data='0e0043006800610074005f0030003100'/>There are these famous hot springs near
  Goron City to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>north<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. I'd love to hang a
  painting of them on the wall here.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>In fact, I understand Gorons love to spend
  their time relaxing in the hot water there.
  
  So what I'd really like to do is paint
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of a Goron soaking in the
  hot springs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0301'/>Ah, but I can't just up and leave this
  place. And if I can't look at the scenery
  for inspiration...how can I paint it?

  on the wall and a stable with a bit more
  personality.
  Those hot springs look so soothing,
  I swear I feel the stress float away
  every time I glance at that picture.

  I have a picture.

  You must not remove it!
  It was made in a place far to the south of

  It's said that the shape of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ring garland<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  brings good luck. We have it on display
  because it's our lucky charm.

  You'll find they sell them in a place called

  Just show me the picture you have in
