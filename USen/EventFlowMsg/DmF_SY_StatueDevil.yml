  I don't see how you can increase your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> any further.
0010: |
  A different container.
talk41: |
  Careful... Give away any more of your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and it could have a
  fatal effect on your health.
0011: |
  Yes.
talk42: |
  Have a care... Give me any more of your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and you may not have
  the strength to stand.
talk77: |
  A dealer in life and power... That was
  me, once.
  
  Alas, my life-for-money bargains didn't
  sit well with the Goddess Hylia.
  
  She turned me into this stone statue
  long, long ago...
  
  Even then, I continued my bargains as a
  statue in a village. Still, the Goddess did
  not like what I was doing.
  I was banished from the main street to the
  outskirts of town, scorned and neglected.
  But that was not enough for her.
  Again I was sent away. I spent time
  trapped in a pond, with only fish for
  company. And finally...here.
  Perhaps another might have learned a
  lesson from this. But I have not.
  
  No, I have only been biding my time for
  the moment when someone who can hear
  me appears. Someone such as you.
  I'm sure we can reach a beneficial
  arrangement. I have dealt only with fish
  for too long. And fish make terrible deals.
0012: |
  No.
talk43: |
  No, no... I'm afraid you already have all
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> you possibly can.
talk78: |
  Hold still, and don't fret. I'll take care of
  everything. This won't hurt a bit.
0013: |
  Tell me more...
talk44: |
  No, no... I'm afraid you already have all
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> you possibly can.
talk45: |
  Then the bargain is struck!
0015: |
  Goodbye.
talk47: |
  I'm currently without any of your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essences<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Are you in the mood to sell?
0017: |
  Give it back.
0018: |
  Give me a heart.
near00: |
  ...
0019: |
  Give me stamina.
talk16: |
  Then... What are you still doing here?
talk17: |
  You...
talk18: |
  It's simple. I'll give you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>100 rupees <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to
  take one of your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or a<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>
  Stamina Vessel <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>off your hands.
  You can have one back for <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>120 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  And if it's not the same one you gave
  me, why, I won't tell a soul.
  Exchanging a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Container<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for a<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>
  Stamina Vessel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, or vice versa, for only
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>20 rupees <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>sounds good, doesn't it?
  You must be salivating at the idea, so
  let's go ahead and strike our bargain.
talk65: |
  My touch is as subtle as ever...
  
  
  Note how I took that <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essence <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>from you
  without leaving a mark.
0000: |
  Yes, please.
talk31: |
  Come to tamper with your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essence<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, yes?
0001: |
  Thanks, but no.
talk32: |
  No, eh? Fa ha ha... If you say so.
  
  
  Just know that I'm willing to strike a
  bargain with anyone who can hear
  my voice.
talk33: |
  I still have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><2 Type='14' Data='2e004e0070006300440065006d006f006e005300740061007400750065005f0055007400750077006100530075006d00ffff00cd'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essences<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  Shall I return another <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Container<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to you?
talk68: |
  Which type of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essence <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>will you surrender
  to me?
0003: |
  Never mind.
talk34: |
  I wouldn't object if you wanted to give
  me more <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk69: |
  Which type of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essence <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>shall I grant you?
talk80: |
  What's this?
  
  
  You haven't received even one more
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Container<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
  
  Such a pity... I was eager to help you
  with a minor <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>transaction<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. But not if you
  have nothing to trade.
  Consult a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goddess Statue <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to improve
  yourself, and then return here to pray.
0004: |
  Heart Container.
talk35: |
  I still have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><2 Type='14' Data='2e004e0070006300440065006d006f006e005300740061007400750065005f0055007400750077006100530075006d00ffff00cd'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essences<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>...
  Shall I return another <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  to you?
0005: |
  Stamina Vessel.
talk01: |
  What's the worst that could happen?
talk36: |
  I wouldn't object if you wanted to give
  me more <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk82: |
  Fa ha ha...
talk37: |
  I don't see how you can reduce your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> any further.
talk38: |
  I don't see how you can reduce your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> any further.
talk84: |
  Fa ha ha... Did you think I'd
  deceived you?
  
  Perish the thought. I hope that ours will
  be a long and profitable relationship.
  
  So which will it be?
talk04: |
  Very interesting choice... Just don't
  come crying to me later.
talk39: |
  I don't see how you can increase your
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> any further.
0009: |
  I've had enough.
0020: |
  I'm all right for now.
talk05: |
  I know from swindles, boy, and I can
  plainly tell that you don't have the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>120 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> required.
talk52: |
  Ahhh... So there are some who still
  pay me homage.
talk87: |
  A wise choice. Now, remain still.
talk53: |
  You don't say... You can hear my voice?
talk88: |
  You look skeptical. Not to worry.
  
  
  Money and life are all as one to me.
  
  
  If you're ready to begin, then first you
  must sell me either type of <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essence <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>100 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  If you want to buy an essence back,
  the price rises to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>120 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Before you cry foul, know that you may
  choose which one I return to you:
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Container<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> or a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  I'm eager to help tamper with your
  essence anytime you want to return
  and pray here.
talk54: |
  Now, that is a surprise.
  
  
  What were you praying for? Long life?
  Wealth, like so many of your kind?
  
  Whichever it was, you came to the
  right place.
talk89: |
  Now then, shall we strike a bargain?
0024: |
  Ugh...
talk20: |
  The price to return a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Container<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to
  you will be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>120 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
0025: |
  You can talk?!
talk21: |
  I'll gladly pay you <0 Type='3' Data='0100'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>100 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='0100'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for one
  of your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Heart Containers<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Is that what
  you want?
0026: |
  Have another one.
talk22: |
  The price to return a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessel<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to
  you will be <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>120 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
talk57: |
  You came to pray, then... You want what
  everyone wants. Long life and wealth.
0027: |
  I want one back.
talk23: |
  I'll gladly pay you <0 Type='3' Data='0100'/><0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>100 rupees<0 Type='3' Data='0100'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for one
  of your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Stamina Vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Is that what
  you want?
talk59: |
  Hmm...
talk26: |
  I have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><2 Type='14' Data='2e004e0070006300440065006d006f006e005300740061007400750065005f0055007400750077006100530075006d00ffff00cd'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> of your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>essences <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>so far.
  What now, hmmm?
