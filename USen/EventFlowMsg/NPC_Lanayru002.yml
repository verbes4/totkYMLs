  done that before? Crafting a shield that
  way will make it really fast!
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>You've got the ol' shield-surfing fire in
  you, doing things no one's done.<5 Type='0'/> The

  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>radiant shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!
  
  Yeah, for sure. Shredders consider that
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ridiculously rare shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. If you're gonna
  be fearless out there, that's a good one.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Very sturdy. Slides like a dream!

  At least get dressed.

  Good shield. Seems pretty sturdy. 
  
  I've heard the Gerudo use these all the
  time to slide on sand dunes.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Should be great for us shield surfers
  then too.
Talk14: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Is that shield on your back the one Teach
  gave you as thanks for saving her?
  
  Whoa. In the shield-surfing world, there's
  talk that it fell from the sky, and that it's
  made of a mysterious material.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>From the looks of it, seems harder to
  believe that it's nice and solid. But it is.
  Easy to slide on too.
  Mysterious! But it's a good shield for
  those who really want to slide with ease.
Talk20: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Hmm?<5 Type='0'/> Hang on. That shield...<5 Type='1'/><0 Type='4'/>It's been modified! Yeah, that's going
  to be its own thing out there.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>I see...<5 Type='0'/> Less friction. Easier to slide on.
  Good choice for a beginner too.
Talk15: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>Oh...<5 Type='0'/> You're rocking the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Daybreaker<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>!<5 Type='1'/>
  Quite the stylish choice.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Super sturdy. Sophisticated look.
  Good at what it does.
  
  Oh yeah, it's an excellent one for
  shredding on the slopes.
Talk21: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/>Hmm?<5 Type='0'/> Hold on. That shield...<5 Type='1'/> It's been
  modified, but...<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/>I gotta say...<5 Type='1'/>I think the change makes it
  harder to slide on. The reverse of
  what you'd want.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Well, no one in shield surfing's gonna
  tell you not to use that. So, I guess you
  can see how it goes out there.
Talk16: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Hey, I know that thing.<5 Type='0'/> Oh yeah. It's a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>steel Lizal shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.<0 Type='4'/>Sturdier than sturdy. That's what it's
  really known for.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1800540061006c006b0050006f00730069007400690076006500'/>That shield won't break easily if you
  hit the slopes with it fiercely. Good one
  for really shredding like a maniac.
Talk22: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/>Hmm?<5 Type='0'/> Hold on. That shield...<0 Type='4'/>Looks like it's been modified! <5 Type='1'/>So you
  made some tweaks for speed, huh?<5 Type='0'/><0 Type='4'/><3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>Doesn't look like it's any less slick, at
  least. You should keep experimenting
  until you get it perfect!

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='18005300750072007000720069007300650053005f0030003000'/>What, what, whaaat?!<5 Type='0'/> No way.<5 Type='1'/> No!<5 Type='0'/> Way!
  
  
  That's a real <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hylian shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?!<0 Type='4'/>Oh, yeah. A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>legendary shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. Hey, you
  did good, gettin' your hands on that.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/><4 Type='0' Data='1000480061007000700079005f0030003000'/>You should be able to slide really fast
  with it. Even when you're not on snow.
  On sand too—and sand's a beast.
  That shield is super sturdy and will take
  a lot of damage on the slopes. It won't
  break for a long, long time.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You'll enjoy that beauty for sure.
Talk17: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>That a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>royal guard's shield <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>I see on
  your back?
  
  It's not a bad shield. But yeah, maybe
  not the best for shield surfing. It's
  not sturdy enough to last.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0c00'/><4 Type='0' Data='10005400680069006e006b005f0030003000'/>Hmm...<5 Type='0'/> It's just plain too breakable.
  
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Nope. Can't recommend it to anyone
  who's tryin' to get the hang of how to
  shield surf.
Talk01: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>OK, here's the straight shot on
  shield surfing—the most important thing
  is which shield you choose.
  So, my man, here's what I'll do for you.
  I'll give you shield advice. Consider it
  more thanks for rescuing Teach.

  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003000'/>Oh?<5 Type='0'/> Let's see, you're carrying a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>royal shield<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, right?
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0001'/>Good shield. Handsome design. A fine
  balance between sturdiness and its
  ability to sliiide.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Might be too refined for a starter shield,
  but yeah, good overall.
Talk30: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>Hey, maaan!<5 Type='0'/> You're missin' the most
  critical thing. The shield!<5 Type='1'/>
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>You DO know these are pretty sacred
  slopes for shield surfers, right? You
  can't come in here empty-handed.<5 Type='1'/>
  No shield, no surfing. Come back when
  you get your hands on a shield.
Talk02: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='10004700720065006500740069006e006700'/>Always up for shield talk, my man. Count
  on me for advice. Got plenty to say!
Talk19: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>Hmm...<5 Type='0'/> That shield you're carrying is
  pretty decent.
  
  Looks sturdy and seems like it'd slide
  pretty OK.
  
  <3 Type='0' Data='0700'/><4 Type='0' Data='1e00540061006c006b0050006f007300690074006900760065005f0030003100'/>Yeah, solid choice in general for anyone
  startin' out with shield surfing.
Talk25: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b01'/><4 Type='0' Data='12004e006f0074006900630065005f0030003100'/>Hmm?<5 Type='0'/> Wait a minute. Your shield...<5 Type='1'/><0 Type='4'/>Whoa. You've attached a sled. Way to
  expand what's possible! Crafting a shield
  that way will really make it slide.
  <3 Type='0' Data='0800'/>That's a shield surfer for you—stayin'
  flexible. Yeah, forget the old ways of
  doing things if you need to!
Talk31: |
  <3 Type='0' Data='0b00'/><4 Type='0' Data='1200530075007200700072006900730065004d00'/>Can't believe anyone would come to
  these most sacred slopes for shield
  surfers...<5 Type='0'/>without a shield.<5 Type='1'/>
  <3 Type='0' Data='0701'/>If you're itchin' to hit the slopes, my
  man, come back after you get your
  hands on a shield.
