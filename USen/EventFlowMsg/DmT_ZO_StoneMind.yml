  You're the one we've been hearing this whole time?
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_009_b: |
  Yes. And it is important you know more about the
  stone and the Demon King.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_010_c: |
  So listen closely to what I have to say.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_012_b: |
  It concerns the Imprisoning War and the destiny of
  our people.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_003_c: |
  Indeed. I am your ancestor from a time long past.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_004_b: |
  I served the first King of Hyrule as a Zora warrior and
  a sage who, like you, could direct the flow of water.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_005_b: |
  You are the pride of the Zora. Your fluid, graceful
  movements as you fight... I would expect nothing less
  from my descendant.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_006_b: |
  You bested the monster that sullied our domain, but it
  was a servant of a greater evil—the Demon King.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_000_b: |
  Sidon, my cherished kin.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_007_b: |
  His true purpose was to prevent you from obtaining
  the stone that you just found—my secret stone.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_001_b: |
  That voice again.
DmT_ZO_StoneMind_Text_008_b: |
  That stone that you are wearing?
