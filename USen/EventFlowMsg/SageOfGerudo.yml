  There are spoils from the battle in the

  If you are looking for Lady Riju, she said

  in the sand shroud and quickly departed.
  She didn't take anyone with her...
  I'm glad the chief does not possess an
  overly cautious nature, but at times
  she can be a bit reckless.
  Could you find her? I would feel better
