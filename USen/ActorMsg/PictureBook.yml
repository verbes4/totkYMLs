Enemy_Bokoblin_Dark_Caption: |

  Bokoblins a mere nuisance. They have been
  influenced by Ganon's fiendish magic, so they
  are stronger than even the Black Bokoblins.
  It's said that the Demon King's power marked
  their silver bodies with purple patterns. The
  magical glow at the tip of their horns may look
  funny at a glance, but don't take these creatures
  lightly, or the joke will be on you.

  intruder and their surroundings in ice.
Enemy_Golem_Middle_Caption: |
  This enormous monster is naturally
  camouflaged as a rock formation. Neither

  enough to run away. They communicate via
  howls, so if you're wandering the forest and
  hear their call, you had best take care.

  livestock. It's said that all Hylian retrievers
  are descendants of the dog once owned by
  the king of Hyrule.
Enemy_LikeLike_Tar_Caption: |
  These sludge-loving Like Likes are
