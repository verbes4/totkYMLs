GoToBackOfTempleOfTimeAfterWD: |
  After you offered four Lights of Blessing, the
  Goddess Statue purged gloom from your body.
  You're far from being restored to your former
  full vitality, but it was enough to open the door.
  Rauru said he'd done all he could for Zelda and
  that now it was up to you. He then vanished,
  leaving you alone with the temple's final altar.
  Perhaps his parting words will soon be clear.
LookingForZelda: |
  You didn't find Princess Zelda on the sky
  island where you awoke. When you touched the
  light in the Temple of Time, you felt her
  presence, however faintly, as a voice rang out
  in your mind: "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Link, you must find me.<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  
  Where is Princess Zelda? Was there anything
  more she was trying to tell you?
Name: |
  Find Princess Zelda
GetZonauMajic: |
  You found yourself on a strange island in the
  sky after you awoke. A steward construct
  claimed that Princess Zelda gave it her
  Purah Pad, all to get it into your hands.
  
  The device's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>map <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>shows a yellow point of
  light. The construct said that's where you'll
  find the princess.
GoToAlterAfterGetRR: |
  In the Temple of Time, you approached
  an altar, and in a flash of light, you found
  yourself with Princess Zelda. That is, with
  some phantasmal floating vision of her.
  
  She took your hand and gave you an ability
  to control time that's known as Recall. Now,
  the temple's deeper mysteries await you.
WarpToCaveOfAwake: |
  Rauru said you can't open the door at the back
  of the temple because you're still too weak.
  
  You need to get one more <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Light of Blessing <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>at
  the island's final shrine to offer at the
  Goddess Statue. The shrine is marked by a
  bright dot on the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>map<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You can go near there
  instantly with the Purah Pad's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>travel <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>feature.
GoToBackToGolemInTemple: |
  After going to the final shrine that Rauru
  told you about, you now have four
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Lights of Blessing<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. 
  
  If you offer them at the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Goddess Statue<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the
  temple, you may regain enough strength to
  take on the door's test of vitality.
