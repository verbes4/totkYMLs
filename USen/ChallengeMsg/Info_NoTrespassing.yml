  None Shall Pass?
Carry: |
  You located what looks like a shrine inside the
  forest. Perhaps this was the place Zooki was
  talking about. It seems that you can enter the
  Shrine of Light if you offer up a crystal.
  
  Follow the ray of light, and offer up the crystal
  at the shrine.
Step01: |
  According to Zooki, he once went deep into the
  forest and found something similar to a shrine.
  But now there are lots of monsters about, so
  he's keeping watch to prevent Koroks from
  going there.
  
  Since you're not a Korok, though, it should
  be fine to enter.
Complete: |
  You offered up the crystal that came from the
  Stone Talus, and a Shrine of Light appeared.
  
  Enter the shrine in order to acquire the
  Light of Blessing.
