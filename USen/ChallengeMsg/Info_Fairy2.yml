  It's said that the Great Fairy who lives on the
  lower slope of a mountain near Snowfield Stable
  won't come out of her bud. Mastro thinks the
  Stable Trotters' horn music will bring her out.
  
  They'd like to go to her, but their <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wagon has no
  roof<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, so he's worried the band will catch cold in
  the snow. For now, they're stuck at the stable.

  The Stable Trotters' performance inspired the
  Great Fairy to leave her bud. The horn player,
  Eustus, was moved that she enjoyed his
  music. Mastro gave you a silver rupee as a
  thank-you for helping his troupe.
