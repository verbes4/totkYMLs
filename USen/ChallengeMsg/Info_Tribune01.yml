  The Gathering Pirates
Report: |
  You defeated every last one of the monsters
  staying at North Akkala Beach.
  
  Return to East Akkala Stable and let Aya know
  that the monsters are gone.
Exterminate: |
  Aya is worried that a group of monsters at
  North Akkala Beach may come threaten
  the stable.
  
  It seems like she won't really feel safe until
  every last one of the monsters has been
  dealt with.
Complete: |
  Aya seemed relieved to learn that the monsters
  staying at North Akkala Beach had been dealt
  with. Hopefully the workers at the stable will
  be able to relax now.
