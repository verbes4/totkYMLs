  Camera Work in the Depths
TakePicture: |
  You found Robbie inside the chasm, down in
  the Depths. He unlocked your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and 
  asked you to give it a try, by taking a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  of a nearby statue. 
  
  The statue seems to be very similar to the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>figure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on the slate fragment that Josha
  is studying.
GotoUnderground: |
  Josha showed you an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>image of a figure<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on a
  piece of slate from <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>the Depths<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. She thinks it's
  evidence of a people that once lived there.
  Robbie said he'd go to the Depths to find her
  anything that shows another such figure. He
  wants you there to take a picture of it with the
  Purah Pad's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>camera<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, if necessary. Join him at
  the chasm south of Lookout Landing.
ReturnBaseCamp: |
  You took a picture of the statue, and Robbie
  said it captured the mysterious figure well.
  
  Head to Lookout Landing and show the picture
  to Josha.
Complete: |
  You returned to Lookout Landing with your
  picture of the statue. Josha said you'd made
  a big discovery that could lead to truly
  understanding what the Depths are.
  
  She's going to search through what others have
  found in the Depths, hoping to find more slate
  fragments with these mysterious people.
