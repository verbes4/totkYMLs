  When you shared Autobuild with Josha, she
  expressed that she wants to see the power
  in action.
  
  She asked you to use <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Autobuild<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> to repair
  the broken balloon at Lookout Landing.
Name: |
  A Mystery in the Depths
Step01: |
  Josha pieced together a large mural from
  fragments to complete a picture that might
  show a series of statues in the Depths.
  
  Each one looks toward the next, until the last
  gazes at a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>temple-like building <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>that's the focal
  point of the mural. Josha thinks this place may
  be real and hold a special Zonai power.
Complete: |
  With the help of Autobuild, you fixed the
  broken balloon. Both Josha and Robbie were
  impressed. The results of this investigation
  reaffirmed the importance of the Depths to
  Josha. She has asked you to let her know if you
  make any new discoveries in the Depths.
AfterInterview: |
  Josha is looking for help to investigate the
  Depths due to a new discovery. She said
  you've come at a perfect time and has
  selected you to help her.
  
  Go with Josha to hear more about the
  upcoming investigation.
Report: |
  Just as Josha thought, when you went where
  each statue was looking in the Depths, you
  found your way to a temple-like building. There
  you acquired the Zonai ability Autobuild.
  
  Report your discovery to Josha at
  Lookout Landing.
