  The Missing Farm Tools
Step1: |
  It seems that Princess Zelda borrowed a
  stable's farm tools and hasn't returned them.
  Penn has some wild notions about why she'd
  need such tools—and why she hasn't returned
  them. But he wants more facts.
  
  Apparently Izra, who looks after the stable's
  raft, might have more details.

  You discovered why Princess Zelda borrowed
  the stable's tools and failed to return them:
  she was working on a garden at Floret Sandbar
  with Magda, but that was shortly before the
  princess vanished during the Upheaval. Penn

  glimpse of something special few but the
  princess knew about.
