  Kilton wants Hudson to craft a sculpture that
  looks like a Bokoblin for him, but he's finding it
  difficult to describe what a Bokoblin looks like.
  
  Hudson explained that he'd have no problem
  making the sculpture if he had a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>detailed picture<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  of the monster to look at for reference.

  It's been a dream of Kilton's to teach folks
  about monsters and help them see that they
  have good traits too. He's thrilled to be on
  his way toward making that dream a reality.
