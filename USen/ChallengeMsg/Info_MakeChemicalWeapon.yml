  Decorate with Passion
Step1: |
  Boraa was asked by her mentor to decorate a
  weapon, but she was stumped by the specific
  request to make it sparkle and radiate burning
  passion. She's also unable to use monster
  parts in the task.
  
  Perhaps she would benefit from seeing a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>weapon to use as a reference<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Step2: |
  Boraa was troubled by a mentor's request.
  She was unsure how to go about decorating a
  weapon, but once you showed her a weapon
  that sparkled and radiated burning passion, her
  worries subsided.
  
  Make some space in your pouch, then accept
  the reward for your efforts.
