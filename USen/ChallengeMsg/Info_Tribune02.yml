  Princess Zelda Kidnapped?!
Search: |
  It seems the Yiga have kidnapped Princess
  Zelda. The ruffians left behind a single clue:
  "We have taken Zelda to the carved-out
  heart of the towering twins!"
  
  The word "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>twins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>" seems to have caught
  Penn's attention...
Escape: |
  You followed the clue that the Yiga left behind:
  "We have taken Zelda to the carved-out
  heart of the towering twins!"
  
  You thought you had found Zelda trapped in
  a cage, but it was really a Yiga in disguise.
Complete: |
  The imprisoned Zelda was an impostor. You
  escaped the Yiga's trap and reported the truth
  of the matter to Penn. It seems he'll retell the
  exciting tale in an upcoming newspaper article.
