  Zumi is hoping to repair a busted wagon, but
  she doesn't have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>wheels <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>she can attach to it or
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>horse <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to pull it.
  
  There are building materials at the stable and
  some wild horses in the area, but if she's going
  to finish this project, she'll need a helping hand.

  Horse-Drawn Dreams
Complete: |
  Zumi's dream of a horse-drawn wagon once
  looked hopelessâ€”she didn't have wheels, or
  even a horse. But you repaired the wheels and
  caught a horse, resulting in a horse-drawn
  wagon she can feel proud to own.
  
  This wagon she dubbed "Zunk," a combination
  of your name and hers.
