FirstOracle: |
  You went to a hill near South Akkala Stable,
  where a Cucco who talks—and speaks
  prophecy—actually exists.
  
  It said that if you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>faced some trials<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, it would
  somehow lead to more information about
  Princess Zelda.
FinishFirstTrial: |
  You agreed to face the first trial that the
  prophecy-speaking Cucco put before you. Yet,
  after you succeeded, it said you had to face
  a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>second trial<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  If you do that one, you'll finally get that
  information about Princess Zelda.
TalkKokkko: |
  Penn scoured near South Akkala Stable for
  news leads but couldn't find any. He thought
  it'd possibly be a good idea to ask a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Cucco
  who speaks prophecy <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>for leads.
  
  The bird is on the hill behind the stable, under
  a large tree.
Name: |
  The All-Clucking Cucco
SecondOracle: |
  After you completed the first trial, the
  prophecy-speaking Cucco said that you had
  to face a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>second trial<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. You agreed, and now
  must complete it.
  
  If you do, you'll finally get that information
  about Princess Zelda.
Complete: |
  The prophecy-speaking Cucco was a ruse
  created by the Yiga Clan to lure you to your
  doom. When Penn heard your report, he said
  it'd all make a great story for the newspaper.
  He's going to write about what happened
  to warn readers about false oracles.
Battle: |
  You completed the trials that the
  prophecy-speaking Cucco put before you,
  only to learn it was a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Yiga trap<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. They
  wanted to exhaust you with needless
  work—and then attack!
