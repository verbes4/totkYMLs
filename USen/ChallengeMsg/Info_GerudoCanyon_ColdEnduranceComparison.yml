Name: |
  Cold-Endurance Contest!
Prepare: |
  Rahdo has challenged you to a contest of
  endurance. To win, you must stand atop a pillar
  through the cold of the night in nothing but
  your underwear.
  
  So long as you do not touch the ground, you're
  allowed to do whatever it takes to endure.
Complete: |
  You managed to defeat Rahdo in his
  cold-endurance contest.
  
  However, Rahdo refused to take your victory
  lying down and immediately challenged you to
  a heat-endurance contest.
