  Volcon and Tray want to go moon-gazing. They
  spoke of a place where you can see the full
  moon shining on the ground at midday, but they
  can't recall how to get there. They only know
  that it is at Lake Ferona in Eldin Canyon.
  
  They might recall if they had a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>picture of the
  full moon shining on the ground <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>during daylight.

  When Volcon and Tray saw the picture, they
  were able to recall the location where the full
  moon shines during daylight. They felt better
  and were happy to recall the memory of
  that place.
