  The art of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Boulder Breaker<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> is passed down
  over generations. But Fugo, the apprentice,
  gave up on making it midway and sold the
  materials he was using for marbled rock roast.
  
  To complete the Boulder Breaker and earn his
  master's approval, he needs a cobble crusher,
  three diamonds, and five pieces of flint.

  Fugo successfully finished the Boulder Breaker
  and will inherit the forge from Rohan.
  
  If your <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Boulder Breaker <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>breaks, Fugo will fix it
  for you.
