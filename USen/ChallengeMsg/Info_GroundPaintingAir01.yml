Complete: |
  You found a pool in a geoglyph that was likely
  one of the Dragon's Tears. Upon touching it,
  you had a strange vision about Princess Zelda.
  
  Impa believes that the Dragon's Tears are
  connected to the princess in some way. Go in
  search of every geoglyph to find more clues
  about what's happened to her.
Carry: |
  Impa was investigating a geoglyph near New
  Serenne Stable. She's frustrated because
  it's impossible to see the full picture from
  the ground.
  
  If you fix the broken balloon she told you about,
  she might be able to get a bird's-eye view.
Search: |
  You hitched a ride on the balloon and saw the
  whole geoglyph from the air. According to Impa,
  hidden somewhere in the geoglyph is something
  called a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Dragon's Tear<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Search the most likely spot to find it.
