  The Flute Player's Plan
step1: |
  Pyper tried to make the glowing tree of
  Haite's dreams by lighting it on fire, but his
  efforts turned to ash. Now he's fired up to
  try again using fireflies.
  
  He needs <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>10 sunset fireflies<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for his
  next attempt.
step4: |
  Accompanied by the flute, the fireflies lit up the
  darkness and made the tree glow spectacularly.
  Haite felt a swell of emotion and could not hold
  back a true smile. Inspired, Pyper vowed to
  return to the Stable Trotters to hone his craft
  and use his music to keep Haite smiling.
  
  Pyper would like to give you a thank-you gift.
step2: |
  You gave Pyper 10 sunset fireflies.
  
  In order to show off his glowing tree, Pyper
  wants you to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bring Haite to the tree at night<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
