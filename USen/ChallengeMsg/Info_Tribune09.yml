  Zelda's Golden Horse
HorseTake: |
  Penn's research at Snowfield Stable turned up
  a story about Princess Zelda's golden horse,
  which has a mane braided with honeycomb
  plaits. It was being kept there but <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ran off<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  somewhere <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>to the north<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Harlow can't go look for the horse, given that a
  huge monster is apparently in the snow fields.

  You found the golden horse, and Harlow was
  beside herself when you returned the gentle
  creature to the stable. She asked you to take
  the horse, as it already seems attached to you.
  Penn flew off to write the whole story up for the
  newspaper.
