Name: |
  The Great Tumbleweed Purge
Step1: |
  Barles is trying to clean up a mountain of
  garbage but can't cope with a large number
  of tumbleweeds that have blown in. She's
  tried to dispose of them one by one, but
  they just keep rolling back.
  
  If she could only get rid of the tumbleweeds,
  then she'd make some progress on cleaning.
Report: |
  You cleaned up all of the tumbleweeds for
  Barles. She wanted to give you a reward
  for your trouble, but your pouch was full.
  
  Make some room in order to accept her gift.
Complete: |
  You cleaned up the tumbleweeds that were
  piling up in the mountain of garbage. After
  they were gone, Barles gave you her thanks
  and was eager to take on cleaning up the
  garbage pile...somehow.
