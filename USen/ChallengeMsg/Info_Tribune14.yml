  The Blocked Well
Step1: |
  Penn's sources told him that Princess Zelda
  ordered the well to be made off-limits, but the
  reason she did so is a mystery.
  
  Penn thinks it'd be helpful to go down the well
  to look for clues, but his wings are too wide for
  him to fit.
Step2: |
  After climbing down into the well, you found a
  rock wall inside and broke it—revealing a cave
  crawling with monsters.
  
  For the safety of those at the stable, you
  should probably defeat them.

  You told Penn what was going on at the bottom
  of the well. Now, it's clear why Princess Zelda
  didn't want anyone to use the well—there was
  a den of monsters down there, and she must
  have known about it. Penn is relieved to have
  this mystery sorted out. He's going to write up
  the whole story for the newspaper.
