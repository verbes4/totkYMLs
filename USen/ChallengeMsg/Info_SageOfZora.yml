MeetParkShido: |
  After the Upheaval, sludge started pouring from
  the sky around Zora's Domain. That foul
  gunk has caused much suffering.
  
  Yona, the Zora prince's fiancée, filled you in on
  the troubles at the domain. She asked you to
  meet with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sidon <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>at Mipha Court on the summit
  of Ploymus Mountain. 
InterimReportToShido: |
  Speaking with Jiahto and the Zora children led
  you to King Dorephan, who was injured when a
  Princess Zelda look-alike loosed a monster
  upon him. The phenomena troubling the Zora—
  the sludge, the monster, the princess—all seem
  connected to the sky.
  
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sidon<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> will be eager to hear this news.
GoToBeforeDungeon: |
  When you activated a mysterious device in the
  Ancient Zora Waterworks, a jet of water erupted
  from the ruins high above.
  
  Even a Hylian could climb the resulting waterfall
  by wearing the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zora armor<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
GoToBossArea: |
  You poured water from the vessels on the
  sludge, but it was inadequate to cleanse the
  area. It seems even more water is needed.
  A <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>mysterious voice indicated locations<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that
  may be of assistance.
  
  Work with Sidon to open all of the faucets.
TryOneTank: |
  After climbing the waterfall and entering the
  ruins, you found the source of the sludge
  plaguing the Zora.
  
  Sidon suggested that it may be possible to
  wash away the foul substance using the
  water in the enormous <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>water vessels<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Name: |
  Sidon of the Zora
GoToUnderLake: |
  Sidon used his impressive swimming prowess to
  create a whirlpool in the lake, revealing some
  kind of entrance on the lake bed.
  
  This may lead to clues about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>watery bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  Jump into the whirlpool and investigate.
GoToDungeonStart: |
  Resolving to explore the sky island, you arrived
  at some vast ruins that may hide the answers
  you seek.
  
  Follow Sidon, who went on ahead.
ResearchZora: |
  You met with Sidon at Mipha Court. He has a
  hunch that the cause of the sludge is in the
  sky. In his search for answers, he ordered the
  Zora historian Jiahto to investigate ancient
  documents and the fallen ruins.
  
  Speaking with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Jiahto<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> at Toto Lake may yield
  information about Princess Zelda.
InterimReportToShido_Ex: |
  You encountered King Dorephan in the
  Pristine Sanctum. He was injured when a
  Princess Zelda look-alike loosed a monster
  upon him. It seems that all of it—the sludge,
  the monster, Princess Zelda—is somehow
  connected to the sky.
  
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sidon<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> will be eager to hear this news.
TouchSecretStone: |
  You combined forces with Sidon to defeat the
  monster producing the sludge. What remained
  of the substance dispersed, taking the threat to
  the Zora along with it.
  
  Sidon was left gazing at the strange stone that
  appeared when the sludge vanished.
ReportToParkShido: |
  A pillar of light appeared at East Reservoir Lake.
  The clues you gathered from the repaired stone
  slate suggest this will lead you to the
  watery bridge.
  
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Sidon<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> will want to hear about this. You can
  find him at Mipha Court.
GoToBeforeDungeon_00: |
  When you activated a mysterious device in the
  Ancient Zora Waterworks, water cascaded from
  the ruins high above to make a giant waterfall.
  
  Even a Hylian can climb waterfalls by wearing
  the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Zora armor<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, which Yona tasked herself
  with repairing...
Complete: |
  With the defeat of the fiend responsible for
  the sludge, the trouble afflicting the region
  was resolved. At the same time, Sidon
  awakened as a sage.
  
  He promised to rally the domain to assist you,
  declaring that it's now the Zora's turn to help
  their hero.
FindWaterBridge: |
  You relayed King Dorephan's story to Sidon.
  Both Princess Zelda's trail and the destructive
  sludge connect to the sky above the domain.
  
  Your objectives align with Sidon's. If you find a
  clue about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>watery bridge <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>connecting the
  Zora to the sky, you should let him know.
GoToLakeShido: |
  You defeated the monster with Sidon's aid.
  Yona pushed the prince to confront his fear of
  loss, and he rose to the occasion. He is ready
  to investigate the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>watery bridge <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>with you.
  
  Sidon will wait for you near the pillar of light<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  that appeared in East Reservoir Lake.
SearchRemains: |
  Upon jumping into the whirlpool, you found a
  vast space filled with ancient ruins.
  
  You may find a clue about the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>watery bridge<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  among them.
DefeatBoss: |
  When you washed away the sludge with the
  water vessels, a monster suddenly emerged
  from the muck. This must be the culprit behind
  the sludge!
  
  It's time to work with Sidon to finish this.
DefeatLakeBoss: |
  When you told Sidon about the pillar of light
  at East Reservoir Lake, a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sludge monster<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  attacked.
  
  Work with Sidon to repel the fiend.
