  The restaurant's chef, Cooke, is angry with
  Mezer for not finishing his meal. He won't let
  Mezer leave until he brings more of the
  <201 Type='4'/><2 Type='30'/> ingredient that was wasted.
  
  Cooke says that <201 Type='4'/><2 Type='30'/> can be
  found in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>caves past the cart tracks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  You handed over the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><201 Type='4'/><2 Type='30'/><0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and
  Cooke finally appears to be in better spirits. As
  a token of gratitude, Mezer says he'd like to
  give you a large Zonai charge.
  
  Make some room in your pouch and talk to him.
