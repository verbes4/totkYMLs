StartBossBattle: |
  With Yunobo's assistance, you successfully
  unlocked the five locks.
  
  The room where you saw Princess Zelda is
  now accessible.
DefeatBoss: |
  Upon destroying the red rock in the ceiling in an
  attempt to rescue Zelda, a large four-legged
  monster appeared.
  
  It seems the monster's body is covered in the
  same <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>red rocks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Complete: |
  Upon returning to Goron City, you found that
  the marbled rock roast had vanished, and the
  Gorons had resumed their usual activities.
  
  Yunobo awakened as the Sage of Fire and is
  excited to help you. He has pledged to continue
  looking for clues about Princess Zelda.
Name: |
  Yunobo of Goron City
GoMinusField: |
  You defeated the monster that emerged from
  Death Mountain's crater, but Princess Zelda
  was nowhere to be seen. Worried that she may
  have fallen into the caldera, Yunobo dove into
  the crater.
GoEntranceDungeon: |
  An area flowing with lava is at the bottom of
  the crater. While taking it all in, you heard a
  mysterious voice call to you, saying, "Come."
  
  A large structure stands in the distance.
  The voice sounded like it was coming from
  that direction.
Dream: |
  Many of the Gorons in Goron City are
  ravenously eating marbled rock roast. Yunobo
  and a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>blond woman <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>seem to be involved with
  this new rock.
  
  Yunobo and the others are now headed for
  YunoboCo HQ to look into some marbled
  rock roast business.
GoCrater: |
  Yunobo came back to his senses. Working 
  together, everyone safely escaped the cave.
  
  If you go to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Death Mountain<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, where Princess
  Zelda and Yunobo last met, you may be
  able to find a lead.
DefeatBossMiddle: |
  Just as you caught sight of Zelda at
  Death Mountain's crater, a massive <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>red rock
  monster <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>appeared from the crater, blocking
  your entry.
  
  In order to follow after Zelda, you must defeat
  the monster.
GoDungeon: |
  Guided by a mysterious voice, you arrived at a
  massive structure.
  
  You spotted Princess Zelda again before losing
  sight of her near the entrance.
Dungeon: |
  Princess Zelda was sucked into the ceiling
  along with the red rocks, and the area is
  blocked by iron bars.
  
  If you go to the five places indicated by the
  mysterious voice, you may be able to clear
  the way.
TouchSecretStone: |
  You defeated the four-legged monster, but
  Princess Zelda was nowhere to be seen.
  Shortly afterward, however, a sparkling stone
  fell from the ceiling.
  
  Yunobo is looking at it with wonder.
