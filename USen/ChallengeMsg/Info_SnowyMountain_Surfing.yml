  At the Spring of Wisdom near the summit of
  Mount Lanayru, Nazbi told you this legend:
  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Skim across snow, from the spring high in the
  heavens to the mountain below. Pass through
  the rings of light to see the Light of Blessing.<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  
  The "spring high in the heavens" in the legend
  may refer to the Spring of Wisdom.

  "Skim across snow, from the spring high in the
  heavens to the mountain below. Pass through
  the rings of light to see the Light of Blessing."
  You jumped from the sky island springs above
  Mount Lanayru, went through the rings of light
  toward the ground, and at the end of it all,
  a Shrine of Light appeared.
