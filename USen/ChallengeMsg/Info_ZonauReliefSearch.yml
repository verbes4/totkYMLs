  It's become clear that there are 13 stone
  tablets documenting the age of legends. By
  deciphering all of them, one could learn about
  the lives of the royal family of that era, which
  was not documented in any history book.

  them to Wortsworth in Kakariko Village. You still

  A priceless stone tablet engraved with ancient
  Hyrulean text has fallen from the sky into
  Lookout Landing. Wortsworth, a scholar of
  ancient Hyrulean, said he intends to decipher
  the text by comparing it to ancient documents
  left at the lab in Kakariko Village.
  
  He's departed for the village in the southeast.

  You found all of the stone tablets and had
  Wortsworth decipher the ancient Hyrulean.
  Through these records of the ancient royal
  family, you got a glimpse of the thoughts and
  feelings of the people from that era. They seem
  to have left a deep impression on Wortsworth.
