  Serenade to a Great Fairy
Carry: |
  A Great Fairy, famous for giving blessings to
  travelers, has shut herself up inside her flower
  bud. Penn suspects that a blond-haired
  woman a musical troupe saw was Princess
  Zelda, and has asked you to look into things.
  
  It seems you'll need to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bring the musicians to
  the Great Fairy <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>if you want to speak with her.

  Though the Great Fairy had gone into hiding
  after hearing of dire things from a woman who
  looked like Princess Zelda, the music of the
  troupe convinced her to emerge. She didn't
  think that woman was the princess, so her
  identity remains a mystery. You did get two
  news scoops though: the return of the Great
  Fairy...and the Stable Trotters.
