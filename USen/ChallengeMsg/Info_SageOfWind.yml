IpponSugi: |
  Tulin was not at the cave when you went out
  to find him. Gesane told you that he left Hebra
  South Summit Cave and went toward the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>lone
  cedar tree<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Talonto Peak<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, visible to the north.
  
  According to Gesane, he saw a group of
  monsters and gave chase alone.
BossBattle: |
  You unlocked the five locks. Once you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>use the
  terminal<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and open the deck hatch, it will be time
  to step forward and stop the frigid winds
  spouting from belowdecks.
CheckTerminal: |
  You found a massive ship, which Tulin says
  is the Stormwind Ark, floating inside the
  thunderhead. A figure greatly resembling
  Princess Zelda was seen on the ship's deck
  before she vanished suddenly. The blizzard,
  which shows no sign of abating, is coming from
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>below the hatch<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. The cause of the Rito's
  suffering seems close at hand.
DungeonStart: |
  You tried using the terminal, but the deck's
  hatch did not open. The mysterious voice then
  spoke to you again, saying the hatch will remain
  shut until all five locks are unlocked.
  
  Find the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>five locks<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> the voice spoke of to save
  Rito Village from the never-ending blizzard and
  to get a lead on Princess Zelda's whereabouts.
Name: |
  Tulin of Rito Village
FoundTulin: |
  Upon reaching the lone cedar tree, you found
  an upset Tulin looking toward the sky.
  
  He said his bow was stolen by a flying monster.
DefeatEnemy: |
  You defeated the Aerocuda and recovered
  Tulin's bow. But before the two of you could
  leave, more Aerocudas arrivedâ€”this time
  flinging Bokoblins at you.
  
  Work with Tulin to defeat the monsters.
TouchSecretStone: |
  The ice covering the altar melted after you
  vanquished the monster, revealing a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shining
  stone<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> set there.
  
  You can sense great power emanating from
  the stone, and Tulin senses it as well.
GoToCave: |
  Harth had no leads on Princess Zelda either.
  He suggested you speak to Tulin, who has been
  scouting the skies since the fierce blizzard
  began.
  
  Harth said that Tulin went to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hebra South
  Summit Cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> with Gesane and Laissa. Its
  entrance is marked with another bonfire.
GetBack: |
  Upon reaching the lone cedar tree, you found
  an upset Tulin. He told you that a flying monster
  stole his bow.
  
  It's up to you to defeat the monster and get
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Tulin's bow<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> back.
GoDungeon: |
  Though you didn't find Princess Zelda where
  Tulin said she'd be, you heard a disembodied
  voice say, "Come to me." Inside the cloud, you
  discovered a great ship, which looks just like
  the one from the Song of the Stormwind Ark.
  
  Is this mysterious voice guiding Tulin <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>into
  the cloud<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>?
Complete: |
  Rito Village is no longer at the mercy of the
  unusual blizzard.
  
  Tulin, who inherited a secret stone from the
  ancient sage to become the new Sage<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>of Wind,
  promised to lend you his power anytime.
MountainHut: |
  A severe blizzard has struck Rito Village, leaving
  it in crisis. Teba had no information for you
  concerning Princess Zelda, but he suggested
  you ask Harth<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>at a nearby lodge.
  
  This lodge is north of the village at the foot of
  the Hebra Mountains, and it's marked by a
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>pair of bonfires<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
GoToHebra: |
  Tulin's recent ordeal has taught him a valuable
  lesson about working together. Even Harth can
  see that the young Rito has matured.
  
  Go with Tulin to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>sky islands<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> above Hebra
  Peak, where he claims he saw Princess Zelda.
DefeatBoss: |
  When the deck hatch opened, a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>massive
  monster <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>emerged. This must be the culprit
  behind the fierce blizzard assailing Rito Village.
  
  Work with Tulin to vanquish the monster.
