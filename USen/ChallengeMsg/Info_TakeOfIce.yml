  The Iceless Icehouse
Step1: |
  Anche, who runs the icehouse, is having a
  problem. The temperatures in the desert have
  risen high enough that it's nearly impossible for
  ice to form.
  
  Anche is busy trying to figure out how to
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>make ice<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Step2: |
  You were able to make some ice, but it turns
  out the ice must be as wide as the alcove.
  
  Anche has asked you to adjust the size of the
  ice and <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>place it in the alcove<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Complete: |
  You gave Anche the ice she asked for, and she
  let you know that you can always come back
  and keep helping her since she'll probably
  need more ice at least once a day. She'll even
  prepare some <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>rewards<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> for you as thanks for
  your help.
