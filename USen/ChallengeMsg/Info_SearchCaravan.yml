Name: |
  Lost in the Dunes
Step1: |
  Ponthos, a bushy-bearded caravan traveler,
  went out through the west entrance and hasn't
  returned yet. Standard caravan practice is to
  wait in a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>conspicuous location<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>—near a tall
  structure, for example—when lost in the desert.
  
  But since a sinkhole is also in this area, finding
  Ponthos isn't going to be easy.
Step2: |
  You smashed through some rocks and made a
  passageway to a ladder leading to the surface.
  Ponthos climbed the ladder and headed back to
  his worried friends.
  
  He said something about a reward waiting for
  you at <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Kara Kara Bazaar<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Step1a: |
  You found the caravan traveler, Ponthos,
  stuck below the sinkhole.
  
  There doesn't seem to be an <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>exit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, and Ponthos
  is just about ready to give up.
Complete: |
  You rescued Ponthos, a missing caravan
  traveler, from the sinkhole. As a reward, he
  gave you his prized orb. He said there is
  someone in Gerudo Town who knows more
  about the orb.
