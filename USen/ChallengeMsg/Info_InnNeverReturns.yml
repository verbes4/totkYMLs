Name: |
  Out of the Inn
Search: |
  Dai was asked to watch over an inn, and he's
  starting to worry that the owner's not coming
  back. He asked you to try to find him.
  
  It seems the owner had gone out to change the
  survey team's bedsheets. Their tents are
  located in four different areas though, so Dai's
  not sure where the owner could be.
Report: |
  You found the inn's owner, Ollie, sleeping in a
  survey-team tent. You woke him up with a
  whiff of a hearty truffle, and he hurried back
  to the inn.
  
  You should do the same, just to see how things
  are going over there.
Complete: |
  Ollie's return to the inn freed Dai from the
  responsibility of watching over it.
  
  And better yet, now you can sleep there.
