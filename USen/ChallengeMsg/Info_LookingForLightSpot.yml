  The Closed Door
GoToLightSpotOfPurahPad: |
  When you tried to open the door to the
  Temple of Time, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Rauru<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> appeared and said
  he was the original owner of your new arm.
  
  He also said you need to revitalize the arm so
  the power of its touch will open the door. To
  do that, visit the island's <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>shrines<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. A green light
  spirals above each of them.
GoBackToTempleEntrance: |
  Rauru appeared after you visited the three
  shrines. He said that you've revitalized
  enough power in your new arm to enter the
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Temple of Time<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  The door will now open at the touch of
  your hand.
Complete: |
  After visiting the three shrines, you returned to
  the Temple of Time. Its door opened to
  your touch, no longer denying you entry.
  Somehow, your new arm was truly revitalized
  enough in those shrines.
