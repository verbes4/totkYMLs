MeetPurah: |
  At the Temple of Time, you saw the Master
  Sword vanish into a mysterious light. A white
  dragon then rose into the sky, parting the sea
  of clouds. You're sure you heard Princess Zelda
  say, "Link, you must find me." Head to the land
  below to look for clues to her whereabouts.
  There's no faster way to do that than to dive
  bravely from the sky island.
