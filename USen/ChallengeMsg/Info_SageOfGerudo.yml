PreDefenseStart: |
  You arrived at Kara Kara Bazaar to find the
  battle underway. Riju demonstrated the results
  of her training, saving Buliara with her lightning.
  
  Fight alongside Riju and defeat the Gibdos!
DungeonStart: |
  When Riju struck the mechanism with one of her
  lightning strikes, a temple appeared. Maybe the
  owner of the mysterious voice is inside?
  
  You should investigate the interior.
Name: |
  Riju of Gerudo Town
PracticeStart: |
  Upon visiting the North Gerudo Ruins, you
  found Riju focused on her training.
  
  You should help her practice her lightning strike.
DefenseStart: |
  A swarm of Gibdos have appeared from within
  the hives that surround Gerudo Town.
  
  Protect Riju and save Gerudo Town!
DefenseEnd: |
  Fighting alongside the Gerudo soldiers,
  you defeated the swarm of Gibdos pouring
  from the hives that threatened Gerudo Town.
  
  Seek out Riju, who asked you to meet her at
  a mural in the underground shelter beneath
  the town.
DungeonSearch: |
  The mural you saw in the Gerudo shelter said:
  "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Standing back-to-back with the throne,
  witness red pillars across a vast sea. Unite the
  pillars in light to reveal the lightning stone and
  open the way. You who can hear my voice,
  come to me. I await you.<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  
  Riju thinks the voice and mural are connected.
DungeonFind: |
  When you shined a light on each of the ancient
  pillars, the bright beams formed a huge triangle.
  
  Based on the mural you saw in the shelter
  beneath Gerudo Town, something should have
  been revealed, perhaps at the center...
PreDefenseEnd: |
  Moments after you defeated the monsters
  attacking Kara Kara Bazaar, Zelda suddenly
  appeared in the distance, along with strange
  tornadoes surrounding Gerudo Town. Zelda set
  out in the direction of the town but quickly
  vanished from sight.
  
  Join Riju and the others back at Gerudo Town.
PracticeEnd: |
  Riju was able to strike the targets with her
  lightning when you used your arrows to guide
  her. Shortly after, a strange sound was heard,
  and then a messenger arrived with news of an
  attack on Kara Kara Bazaar.
  
  Follow Riju to Kara Kara Bazaar, northeast of
  Gerudo Town.
Complete: |
  Riju touched the secret stone and listened to
  her ancient ancestor. A new power awakened
  in her, and she became the Sage of Lightning.
  With the monster defeated, the sand shroud in
  the Gerudo region vanished.
  
  Questions surround Princess Zelda in both past
  and present, but Riju promised to investigate.
DungeonBossDead: |
  A stone emitting some sort of strange light
  appeared when the massive monster—the
  source of the sand shroud—was defeated.
  
  Riju is staring at the stone, but what could be
  going through her mind?
Underground: |
  Gerudo Town has been beset by an ominous
  sand shroud, forcing the people there to retreat
  to an underground shelter.
  
  Chief Riju, however, was nowhere to be seen.
  Fortunately, Buliara informed you that the
  Gerudo leader had gone to the North Gerudo
  Ruins to train.
DefenseReady: |
  Gibdo hives appeared from within the sand
  shroud. While the hives and the tornadoes
  loomed ominously over Gerudo Town, a
  mysterious voice reached out to you once
  more, beckoning you.
  
  Though this is important, you should continue
  to work with Riju and the others.
