Step04: |
  By defeating the monsters in the Ring Ruin
  in the hills west of the village, you showed
  Steen and Olkin that both offensive and
  defensive fighting methods are important.
  
  Trissa has been waiting for them to return.
  Report back to her.
Name: |
  Codgers' Quarrel
Step01: |
  The general store is at risk of running out of
  goods. The two old men who stock the store
  have left to drive monsters out of the Ring Ruin
  in the hills west of the village.
  
  Trissa is worried about the pair but can't leave
  the store to check on them.
Complete: |
  Steen and Olkin, who stock the general store,
  are back home at their village and seem to have
  resolved their differences.
  
  Trissa was beyond happy to see that the two
  are getting along. She gave you an endura
  carrot as thanks.
Step02: |
  Steen and Olkin went to drive monsters out of
  the Ring Ruin in the hills west of the village.
  
  But they're arguing over the right way to deal
  with the problem, and so they're getting
  nowhere with <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>clearing out the monsters<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Step03: |
  You defeated all the monsters in the Ring Ruin
  in the hills west of the village.
  
  You should tell Steen and Olkin. They should be
  glad to hear it, given that they're still arguing
  over the best plan for dealing with them.
