  told you he discovered an old Zora slate.
  There is information related to the sky written
  there, but the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>slate <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>is broken and the full
  meaning is unclear.

  It reads: "Stand upon the land of the sky fish,
  and behold its lofty view. Among the floating
  rocks you see, a droplet waits for you. Through
  this droplet, shoot an arrow with the mark of the
  king. Do this task, and you shall reveal a most
  wondrous thing. See the watery bridge's resting
  spot with your own two eyes...that which
  connects the Zora to the people of the skies."
