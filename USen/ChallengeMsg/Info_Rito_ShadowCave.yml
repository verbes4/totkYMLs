  Laissa, a resident of Rito Village, can't seem to
  recall the location of a cave she found a while
  back. Apparently the cave contained a rock
  matching the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>one wreathed in green light<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>
  beneath the village's general store.
  
  If you ask Laissa again, she may have more
  information that could lead you to the cave.

  Laissa, a resident of Rito Village, can't seem
  to recall the location of a cave she found a
  while back. When you asked what she could
  remember about it, she said that she saw a
  white bird sitting atop the shadow of Vah
  Medoh's perch at early morning. When she tried
  to go after it, the bird was gone, and in its place
  was the entrance to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>cave<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  You found the cave entrance that had slipped
  from Laissa's memory. It seems that the spot
  was marked by a patch of snow in the shape of
  a bird, found atop the tip of the shadow of Vah
  Medoh's perch at early morning.
  
  Inside the cave, you found a Shrine of Light.
