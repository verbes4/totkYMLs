CarryHead_CheckPoint04: |
  When you placed the relic on a pedestal in the
  underground chamber, a path opened into the
  Depths. The mysterious voice spoke again,
  saying, "You must hurry... We must meet as
  soon as possible." When you arrived in a vast
  space within the Depths, the relic began to emit
  another beam to guide you toward the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>ruins<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  Guidance from Ages Past
CarryHead_CheckPoint01: |
  You found a strange relic on Dragonhead Island
  that emitted a narrow beam of light. The beam
  appears to extend straight down to the surface.
  
  When you touched the relic, a mysterious voice
  said to take it and "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>follow the light<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>."
Dungeon_DefeatedBoss: |
  You vanquished the construct animated by the
  Demon King's magic. The remains of that
  construct, built by Mineru long ago, vanished
  along with the gloom filling the temple.
  
  The <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>secret stone of spirit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> sparkles atop
  the altar.
Complete: |
  At last you met the voice's owner, Mineru, the
  Sage of Spirit. She transferred her spirit from
  the Purah Pad, where it had resided, into the
  secret stone. She told you of a battle with the
  Demon King in the distant past, known as the
  Imprisoning War, and of Princess Zelda's
  resolve to restore the Master Sword. Mineru's
  spirit will aid you in the construct she inhabits.
CarryHead_CheckPoint02: |
  The relic's light guided you to a hidden path
  that led underground.
  
  From there, the relic started emitting the beam
  again, leading you down the path.
Dungeon_BeforeBossBattle: |
  Alongside the construct, you headed to the
  Temple of Spirit, where the secret stone is
  housed. Another construct, animated by the
  Demon King's magic, awaited you there.
  
  You must vanquish this construct to claim the
  secret stone of spirit.
Collected_AllParts: |
  Within the vast ruins was a pedestal with a
  hollow carved out in the shape of a person.
  When you placed the relic where the head
  would go, the voice spoke again. Calling herself
  Mineru, the Sage of Spirit, she asked you to
  visit four depots for the parts to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>build a body
  that could house her spirit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, allowing you to truly
  meet her.
Dungeon_DuringDungeonCapture: |
  When you placed the parts collected from the
  four depots in the pedestal, they connected and
  came to life as a large construct. Mineru's voice
  then asked you to bring her to the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>secret stone
  of spirit<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> using the power of the construct.
  
  From Mineru's voice, you learned the location
  of the secret stone.
