  Sayge at Kochi Dye Shop has started using his
  dyeing technique to make different fabrics.
  He wants to make one based on a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Chuchu<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and
  has asked you for a visual reference.
  
  If he could get a good look at a common, blue

  your Chuchu picture and was able to finalize
  his fabric.

  as reference for the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>fabrics Sayge wants to
