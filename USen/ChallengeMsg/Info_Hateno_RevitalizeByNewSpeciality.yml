  A New Signature Food
Step01: |
  Reede wants to make the food that his
  grandfather created with another villager into
  a new village staple. However, all he remembers
  about it is its <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>creamy, melty <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>mouthfeel and its
  unique, pungent aroma.
  
  Reede thinks smelling that aroma again might
  jog his memory.
Complete: |
  It seems Reede's grandfather had worked with
  another villager to make Hateno cheese.
  Convinced it will seal his victory in the mayoral
  election, Reede decides to market it as Hateno
  Village's new signature staple. From now on,
  you can buy Hateno cheese not just at Hateno
  Pasture but also at Hateno Village's general
  store and from merchants on the roads.
