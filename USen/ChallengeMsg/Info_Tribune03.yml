  White Goats Gone Missing
Search: |
  According to Chork, the white goats ran off
  after they were given a special feed made from
  a recipe Princess Zelda created. The only thing
  left behind when they fled were uneaten <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Hylian
  pine cones<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Did the goats really run off because of the food
  they were given? Where did they run off to?
Hearing: |
  It seems that all of the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>white goats <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>kept in
  Tabantha Bridge Stable have run off together.
  According to Penn, these events may somehow
  connect to Princess Zelda.
  
  You may learn more by speaking with the
  stable hand, <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Chork<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, who is responsible for
  the white goats.

  You've found the white goats that went missing.
  Chork is incredibly remorseful for having messed
  up the animal-feed recipe, and even more
  remorseful for having doubted Princess Zelda's
  recipe in the first place. After you told Penn
  what happened, he returned to the newspaper
  to write up an article about the events.
