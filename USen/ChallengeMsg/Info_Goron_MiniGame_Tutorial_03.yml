Complete: |
  You cleared the high-difficulty Death Mountain
  course! Kabetta gave you some fabric to
  reward you for clearing all of Mine-Cart Land.
  He said you can make it into something at
  Hateno Village in southeast Hyrule.
  
  He also said Mine-Cart Land is still accepting
  challengers if you want to play again.
