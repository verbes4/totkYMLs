  True Treasure
Step1: |
  You found Sasan when you entered the cave
  at Tarm Point. It seems Finley ventured deeper
  into the cave without waiting for him.
  
  Sasan needs to board a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>raft <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>to catch up to her,
  but he can't make it far with the water level
  rising and falling. He's not sure what to do...
Step0: |
  Kodah at the inn came across the following
  passage from an ancient text: "<0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Long, long ago,
  at Tarm Point, a blessed stone was hidden
  away within a sacred shrine.<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>"
  
  Kodah's daughter, Finley, believes there must
  be treasure there, and so she and Sasan set off
  for Tarm Point. Does treasure await them?
GetPrize: |
  You let Sasan board the raft in the cave at
  Tarm Point and delivered him safely to Finley,
  who was waiting for him farther inside.
  
  They want to give you a gift in thanks. Call on
  them again after you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>organize your belongings<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.

  They didn't find the treasure they expected at
  the Shrine deep within the cave, but in the end,
  the memories they made together are more
  precious a treasure than any.
