Name: |
  Piaffe, Packed Away
Step1: |
  Gerudo Canyon Stable is being shut down
  after the abnormal weather dried up their
  supply of customers.
  
  Unfortunately for Piaffe, the building is packed
  full of rubbish and he can't bring himself to
  clean it all up. It's a tough situation to be in
  when he's supposed to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>dispose of it all<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Reward: |
  Piaffe offered you a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Pony Point<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> as thanks for
  helping clean up the stable.
  
  However, because Gerudo Canyon Stable is
  officially shut down, you'll need to register as
  a stable member somewhere else.
Complete: |
  You tidied the clutter filling up the stable.
  Now Gerudo Canyon Stable can finally close its
  doors once and for all. Piaffe was appreciative,
  but he also seemed a little sad...
