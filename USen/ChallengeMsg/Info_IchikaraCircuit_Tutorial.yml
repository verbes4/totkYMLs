  Master the Vehicle Prototype
Craft: |
  Fernison from the Zonai Survey Team, with help
  from Hudson Construction, has been turning
  Zonai devices into vehicle prototypes. She has
  one all ready to go...except for one problem:
  No one knows <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>how to control it<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. None of the
  Zonai devices that fell on Tarrey Town seem to
  do the trick. So Fernison has called on a couple
  of professional racers, hoping they might help.
Playing: |
  You've been asked to take the vehicle
  prototype for a test drive and to use the
  steering stick to control it. You'll have to
  touch all of the lights and return to the starting
  point within the time limit you were given.
  Remember, you'll be disqualified if you <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>take
  your hands off the Zonai device or leave the
  course<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Complete: |
  You did it! You drove the course and returned
  to the starting point within the time limit!
  
  Fernison from the Zonai Survey Team says this
  is just the beginning. She seems to have big
  plans in the works!
