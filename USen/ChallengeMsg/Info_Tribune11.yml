Step4: |
  You found members of the Zonai Survey Team
  at the entrance to the Foothill Monster Den
  wearing only their underpants. They said they
  couldn't defeat the monsters inside, dressed
  like that. You agreed to show them how it's
  done, so you will need to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>defeat the monsters
  in the cave wearing only your underpants<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Name: |
  For Our Princess!
Step5: |
  You lived up to the promise you made to the
  Zonai Survey Team members outside the
  Foothill Monster Den and defeated all of the
  monsters while wearing only your underpants.
  
  Report back to them at the cave's entrance.
Complete: |
  When you returned to Foothill Stable and 
  talked to the Zonai Survey Team, you learned
  that Princess Zelda's orders weren't to "explore
  in underpants," but instead "explore all other
  paths." Penn said he'd write up the whole
  story, and then he left.
Step1: |
  A group of fellows in their underpants have 
  settled in at Foothill Stable. Penn says they're
  on the Zonai Survey Team, and they're wearing
  only underpants by order of Princess Zelda,
  which sounds odd all around to him. He's
  also concerned that some of them left to
  investigate a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>monster den<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> on the nearby
  mountain roadâ€”and have not yet returned.
Step6: |
  You defeated the cave monsters wearing only
  your underpants and reported back to the
  Zonai Survey Team members at the entrance.
  
  They've asked you to return to <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Foothill Stable<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>,
  where they plan on telling everyone there
  about your great accomplishment.
