Name: |
  Ride the Giant Horse
Step1: |
  You ran into Baddek, a horse-lover who found
  a beautiful crystal in the mountains southwest
  of the Faron Grasslands. Baddek said he'll give
  the crystal to you if you bring him the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>giant
  horse<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that's rumored to be in the area.
  
  Ask near Highland Stable east of the grasslands
  to see if anyone knows about this giant horse.
Step2: |
  Impressed with the giant horse, Baddek gave
  you the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>crystal<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>, which emits a faint light.
  
  The next step is to figure out what the crystal
  might be used for.
Step3: |
  Baddek gave you a crystal after you brought
  him the giant horse. It seems that you can enter
  a Shrine of Light if you offer up a crystal.
  
  Follow the ray of light, and offer up the crystal
  at the shrine.
Complete: |
  You brought the giant horse to Baddek, and he
  gave you a crystal in return. You offered up the
  crystal and can now enter the Shrine of Light.
