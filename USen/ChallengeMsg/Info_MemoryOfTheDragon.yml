  Impa thinks that the mystery of the geoglyphs
  might connect to something that's inside the
  Forgotten Temple. It's located somewhere
  along the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>bottom of a canyon in Hebra<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
Name: |
  The Dragon's Tears
Step01: |
  Inside the Forgotten Temple is a map of Hyrule
  and 11 murals related to the geoglyphs.
  It seems that these geoglyphs appeared in
  various places after the Upheaval when
  Princess Zelda went missing.
  
  You have <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/><2 Type='14' Data='320052006500730069006400750065005f004d0065006d006f00720079004f00660054006800650044007200610067006f006e00ffff00cd'/> <201 Type='6' Data='1000670065006f0067006c007900700068001200670065006f0067006c0079007000680073000000'/> <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>left to investigate.
Complete: |
  You visited all the geoglyphs and witnessed all
  the memories in the Dragon's Tears. These
  visions showed you Princess Zelda sacrificing
  herself, becoming the Light Dragon, and hoping
  to eventually entrust the Master Sword to you.
  You must honor the princess's wish, somehow.
GoTemple2: |

  Temple. He said that he's come here with Impa
  to find <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>something inside that's connected to
  the geoglyphs<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. She's apparently gone deeper
  into the temple.
  
  See what you can discover in this mysterious
  place.
Step2: |

  Peninsula <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>in the <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Akkala <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>region.
