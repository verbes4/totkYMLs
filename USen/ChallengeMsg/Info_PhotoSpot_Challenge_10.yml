  to have a painting of Floria Falls on a clear day

  He was going to give you a reward, but your
  inventory was full. Be sure to trim your
  belongings before you accept his gift.
Step01: |
  Anly, the owner of Lakeside Stable, wants to
  hang a painting of Floria Falls as seen on a
  clear day. This view is best captured while
  looking at the falls from Floria Bridge.
  
  Maybe there's a way to take a picture of it and
  show it to Anly.

  to have a painting of Floria Falls on a clear day
  hanging on the wall of his establishment.

  image and he'll make a copy to put on display.
