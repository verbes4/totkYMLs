  Princess Zelda, who appeared at Hyrule Castle,
  turned out to be an impostor created by
  Demon King Ganondorf.
  
  The Demon King isn't yet fully regenerated, so
  there may still be time. Return to Lookout
  Landing and talk to Purah.
UnderFindTheFifthSage: |
  You told Purah about the impostor princess
  and how Demon King Ganondorf is trying to
  rise again.
  
  Hyrule Castle remains a devastated place
  and continues to float above the ground.

  Hyrule Castle rose into the air at the start of
  the Upheaval, which tore apart the earth
  underneath it.
  
  Purah believes that Princess Zelda may have
  called out to you from deep in the earth.
