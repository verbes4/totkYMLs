Name: |
  Hestu's Concerns
STEP1: |
  You ran into the Korok Hestu at the foot of
  Lindor's Brow. He's afraid of something and
  has stopped in his tracks.
  
  There are <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>trees <0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>where he pointed, but what
  could he be so afraid of?
STEP2: |
  Hestu lost the Korok seeds that were in
  his maracas. It sounds like it may have been
  the children of the forest who took them.
  
  If you collect <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Korok seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> and bring them to
  Hestu, he says he will help you by expanding
  your inventory.
Complete: |
  You gave Hestu a <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Korok seed<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>. As thanks, he
  sang and danced to expand your inventory.
  
  He also told you that if you bring him more
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>Korok seeds<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> in the future, he will continue to
  expand your inventory.
