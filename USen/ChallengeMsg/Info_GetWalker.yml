  Presenting: Hero's Path Mode!
Step01: |
  Apparently the Purah Pad has a feature called
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>hero's path mode<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> that allows you to review
  where you've been. However, calibrating the
  upgrade will require <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>data from 15 shrine
  locations<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/>.
  
  Have Robbie make the modifications once you
  have the data.
Complete: |
  You gave Robbie data on 15 shrine locations,
  and he successfully updated the Purah Pad.
  
  Now you can use the hero's path mode to see
  where you've been on the map.
