  You defeated the Molduga and rescued Isha.
  
  She asked you to come visit her at her shop in
  Gerudo Town so that she can thank you.
Step1a: |
  Isha was so focused on finding materials that
  she accidentally wandered into a Molduga's
  territory.

  Cara was thrilled to see Isha again and gave
  you a reward for bringing her back. It seems

  She asked you to visit her shop on the surface
