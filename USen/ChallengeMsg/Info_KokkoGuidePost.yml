  Follow the Cuccos
step1: |
  Trissa is at a loss. The local Cuccos are nesting
  somewhere new, and she cannot gather any
  bird eggs for her shop. She says she'd like to
  have 10, since they're such a popular item.
  
  It seems the Cuccos all go off somewhere when
  <0 Type='3' Data='0000'/>morning<0 Type='3' Data='ffff'/> comes.
Complete: |
  You gave 10 bird eggs to Trissa for her shop,
  and she paid you back at above-normal prices!
  Those eggs should allow her to stay stocked for
  a while.
