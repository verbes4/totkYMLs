  Sonia meets with Zelda in private, and when the
  princess is revealed to be a creature under
  Ganondorf's command, Sonia and the real
  Zelda address the threat with confidence.

  by surprise. She falls victim to the scheme.

  After examining the Purah Pad, Mineru accepts
  that Zelda is from a different time and explains
  the only way she might get to the future is by
  using draconification. It's a forbidden act,
  however, because Zelda would need to sacrifice
  her sense of self. Rauru tells a disappointed
  Zelda to speak with Sonia and learn more
  about her power over time itself.

  help to the best of her abilities.

  On the eve of battle, Zelda tells Rauru that in
  her future, she's seen that the Demon King is
  alive, and that it means they won't defeat him
  the next day. Rauru says that he will still do
  what he must, even at the cost of his life.
  If they fail, their last line of defense will be
  the knight in the future, who wields the
  sword that seals the darkness.
