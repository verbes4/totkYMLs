Talk_16: |
  Yes! That hive is out of action!
Talk_45: |
  You'd better look after yourself!
Talk_17: |
  All right! Another hive down!
Talk_18: |
  That's the last of the hives. All we have to
  do now is clear out the rest of the Gibdos.
Talk_47: |
  It's summoning more Gibdos—don't let
  them surround you!
Talk_51: |
  No effect at all... Are our attacks working?
Talk_52: |
  Normal attacks don't do much against
  the Gibdos...
Talk_53: |
  Ugh, there's so much sand. I can't see...
  Where'd it go? Spot anything?
Info_01: |
  I'll leave that area to you, Link!
Talk_54: |
  Maybe the strategy we used with the
  other Gibdos will work here too!
Rouge_BossHint4_00: |
  We've got it cornered here!
Rouge_BossHint4_01: |
  It turned white! Does that mean it's like
  the other Gibdos?
Talk_00: |
  Monsters have appeared outside town!
  Shore up the defenses at the gates!
Talk_58: |
  That light... Maybe we can use it!
Rouge_BossHint4_02: |
  Nothing but sand wherever we look...
  Where did it go?
Talk_01: |
  Enemies have emerged from the hive at the
  east gate! Stop them!
Talk_30: |
  This has to be their leader!
Talk_59: |
  Lightning worked on the others—maybe it'll
  work here too!
Rouge_BossHint4_03: |
  Blasted Gibdos... They just keep coming!
Talk_02: |
  Enemies are pouring out of the hive near
  the north gate too! Take them out!
Rouge_BossHint4_04: |
  Can you do something about the hive?
LastBattleJoin_00: |
  I'm taking you down, Demon King!
Talk_03: |
  Enemies from the hive near the west gate!
  Let's hit it with lightning!
Info_09: |
  Flying enemies from the hive at the north
  gate too! Don't let them overrun us!
Rouge_BossHint4_05: |
  Don't let them surround you!
LastBattleJoin_01: |
  Let's take him down together, Link!
Talk_04: |
  Flying enemies from the hive at the east
  gate! They're heading straight for us!
Info_10: |
  Flying enemies from the west gate's hive!
  Time for a lightning strike or two!
Rouge_BossHint4_06: |
  Are you OK?!
Talk_05: |
  Flying enemies from the hive at the north
  gate too! Wipe them out!
Rouge_BossHint4_07: |
  Link!
Talk_06: |
  Now flying enemies are coming from the
  west gate's hive! Time for some lightning!
Talk_35: |
  Be careful!
Info_12: |
  This thing is going to be a problem...
Rouge_BossHint4_08: |
  Now's our chance! Attack!
Talk_07: |
  The enemies won't stop coming until we
  wipe out all the hives!
Talk_36: |
  Ouch! Are you OK?
Info_13: |
  Hey, the trap is disabled! We can get
  past now!
Rouge_BossHint4_09: |
  It's on the ground! Let's do this, Link!
Talk_08: |
  Clear out all the enemies left in town!
Talk_37: |
  That was a big one... Are you OK?
Info_14: |
  These flames make it impossible to
  go further...
Rouge_BossHint4_10: |
  Watch for the tornado!
Talk_09: |
  Enemies have been spotted inside town!
  Did they break through the gates?
Info_15: |
  Hey, the flames have gone out! Now we
  can move ahead.
Rouge_BossHint4_11: |
  That's it! Our attacks should be
  effective now!
Talk_10: |
  Enemies are nearing the center of town!
  Prepare to attack!
Rouge_BossHint4_12: |
  Almost there, Link! Let's finish this!
Talk_11: |
  Eliminate every enemy you see! We're the
  last line of defense!
Info_17: |
  What? Fireballs now? Ugh... Looks like
  we're stuck again.
Info_18: |
  The fireballs stopped... I'm on my way, Link!
Talk_42: |
  Show me what you can do!
