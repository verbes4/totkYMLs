  Are you all right?
NewText_05: |
  Don't give up!
Raumi_BossHint4_00: |
  Let's go. We have to stop that construct!
NewText_06: |
  Careful!
Raumi_Description_00: |
  Those devices are very dangerous.
  Be careful!
Raumi_BossHint4_01: |
  We will not be able to force our way past its
  defenses. We must think of something else.
Raumi_BossHint2_02: |
  Don't get thrown off by how fast it moves.
  Just wait until it stops, then attack!
Raumi_BossHint4_02: |
  It's dangerous to strike the construct when
  it is on guard!
LastBattleJoin_00: |
  We settle this now, Ganondorf!
Raumi_BossHint2_03: |
  It has to stop moving to attack.
  Wait for that moment...
LastBattleJoin_01: |
  It's time to finish him off, Link!
Raumi_BossNoDamage_02: |
  This thing is quite sturdy. We keep
  knocking it over, but that is all...
Raumi_BossHint4_04: |
  Ugh, it brought out more arms!
  Be careful!
Raumi_BossHint2_05: |
  We won't last long at this rate. We need to
  find another approach.
Raumi_BossHint4_05: |
  Use the Zonai device the construct
  dropped!
Raumi_BossHint4_06: |
  You've almost done it, Link, but remain
  ready for anything!
Raumi_BossCritical_00: |
  That worked!
Raumi_BossHint_02: |
  Maybe we can make use of the devices
  around us?
NewText_11: |
  You need to recover.
NewText_02: |
  Be careful!
NewText_12: |
  Be brave but not careless. Retreat and
  recover your strength!
NewText_03: |
  Stay on your guard!
