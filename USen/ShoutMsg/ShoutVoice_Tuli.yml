  We need to find a way to hurt it!
Tuli_BossHint2_06: |
  I can help you with my control over wind,
  even in these gales! Just give me the word!
Tuli_BossHint4_10: |
  There's gotta be a weak point somewhere!
Tuli_BossHint4_11: |
  Hey, that worked!
Tuli_BossStart_00: |
  This wind is so strong! Don't get blown
  away, Link!
Tuli_BossHint4_12: |
  We have to stay clear of those tornadoes!
  Be careful!
NewText_11: |
  This is dangerousâ€”heal if you can!
Tuli_BossHint4_00: |
  It's really, really big... But I'm sure we can
  do it!
Tuli_BossHint4_13: |
  Link! Don't get too close to the tornadoes!
NewText_12: |
  This'll get really bad if we aren't careful.
Tuli_BossHint4_01: |
  What? Where'd it go?
Tuli_BossHint4_14: |
  Here they come again!
Talk_01: |
  Great job, Link!
NewText_00: |
  Nice one!
Tuli_BossHint4_02: |
  Link! Below you!
Tuli_BossHint4_15: |
  Gooooooo!
LastBattleJoin_00: |
  Sorry for keeping you waiting!
Tuli_BossHint4_03: |
  It's coming from below again!
Tuli_BossHint4_16: |
  Now!
LastBattleJoin_01: |
  I'm with you, Link!
NewText_02: |
  Be careful!
Tuli_BossHint4_04: |
  Link!
Tuli_BossHint4_17: |
  Just a little more, Link!
NewText: |
  Way to go, Link! I'll help too!
NewText_03: |
  Don't let your guard down!
Tuli_BossHint4_05: |
  Ouch!
NewText_04: |
  Whoa! You OK?
Tuli_BossHint4_06: |
  We aren't hurting it at all!
Tuli_BossHint4_07: |
  It doesn't seem to care...
